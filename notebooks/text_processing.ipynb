    ">Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, and, in particular, concerned with programming computers to fruitfully process large natural language corpora.  -- Wikipedia \n",
    "\n",
    "* We interact with technology every single day of our lives, but humans and computers communicate in fundamentally different ways.\n",

    "* languages like python, R, C etc. have well defined rules, where there can be only one meaning attached to a sentance.\n",

       " u'From: jemurray@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (John E Murray)\\nSubject: quality of Catholic liturgy\\nOrganization: The Ohio State University\\nLines: 37\\n\\nI would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my\\nwife and me lately: liturgy, in particular, Catholic liturgy.  In the last few\\nyears it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It\\'s\\ndriving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is\\nthat what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to \\ndo it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we \\npresent to God.  But the best Masses I\\'ve been to were participatory prayers.\\n\\nLately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion\\nof sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do\\n(which is necessary because no one knows what\\'s happening next) is growing.\\nExample.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usually\\non Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, taking\\nthe role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say\\n\"Crucify him\" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we\\'d do it\\nagain.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were \"invited\" to sit\\nduring the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian \"invitation\", \\nI was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seems\\ntypical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the\\nmusicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the\\nliturgy and since no one knows what\\'s happening, the new things have to be\\nexplained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we\\'re just\\nsitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about\\nto be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay\\n\"experts\", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a\\nbias toward doing something rather than nothing--that\\'s just a fact of\\nbureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for\\npeople to be aware of the Lord\\'s presence.\\n\\nSo we\\'ve been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass\\ngoing down?  I don\\'t mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or\\nFriday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware \\nof God\\'s presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should \\njust offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational\\nparticipation in Catholic Masses lately?\\n\\nJohn Murray\\n',\n",

A person from Jesus\\' culture authorized\\nto conduct business \"in John\\'s name\" had full authority over John\\'s\\nfinancial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to\\nwork only for John\\'s benefit and consonant with John\\'s wishes.  It was\\nnot required for the steward to preface each business transaction with\\n\"in John\\'s name\"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney\\nand be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal\\nand religious definitions of \"faith\".)\\n\\nWith this cultural background, praying \"in Jesus\\' name\" does not\\nmandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the\\npetitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous\\n\"fiduciary\" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His\\nKingdom.  The message of \"praying in Jesus\\' name\" is thus closely\\naligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God\\'s\\ndelegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and\\nresponsibilities.  This idea of praying \"in Jesus\\' name\" is not only\\npresent but prominent in the Lord\\'s Prayer, although the verbal\\nforumula is absent.\\n\\nThe act of praying the words \"In Jesus\\' Name\" may be beneficial if\\nthey cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the\\nadvancement of God\\'s Kingdom.  For that reason, I\\'m not quite ready\\nto say that the praying the formula is without meaning.\\n\\nPrayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving,\\netc.) don\\'t seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by\\nChristian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that\\'s B.C.E. or\\nC.E. for you P.C. :-).

Tucker\\t\\tKG2S\\t\\t     drt@athena.mit.edu|\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian\\nlanguage as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things\\nlike \"one essense and three persons\".  Obviously the three-fold\\nbaptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the\\nterm \"three-fold\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly\\nconsistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose\\nfull formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent\\'s.  It\\'s unlikely\\nthat Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine.\\nIndeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do\\nnot believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae\\noccurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in\\nthe name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as\\nwell.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we\\'re commanded in Mat.\\nto baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,\\nand in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.\\n\\n\"Jesus only\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this\\nconsistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of\\nthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I\\'m not the right one to\\nask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not\\nappear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of\\ndealing with the idiomatic phrase \"in the name of\".)\\n\\nThose who use the three-fold formula don\\'t seem to have a standard\\nanswer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus.\\nI suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \"in the name\\nof\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name\\nof Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus\\'\\nauthority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism\\nwith the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there\\'s a\\ncertain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we\\ncould just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn\\'t require the specific\\nthree-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes\\nbaptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\\n\\nOne might well suspect that in the early church, more than one\\nbaptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to\\nbe the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great\\ndamage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that\\nI think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of\\nthe few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize\\nmutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in\\nthe interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that\\nthose groups that actually use \"in the name of Jesus\" now do seem to\\nhave in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I\\'ve said before, I\\'m\\nnot the one to explain what their doctrine is.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little\\n>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing\\n>  program.\\n\\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

I am not\\nat all sure this is the best path to follow.\\n\\tWhile the Bible is, for Christians, the word of God, the \\nrevelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of this\\nrevalation is the Church. I am not recommending any one\\ndenommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian\\ncongregation in which to develop your faith, rather than just\\nreading the Bible.\\n\\tThis does not mean that the Bible should not be read, although\\nI would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid the\\nBook of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you are\\ncomfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects to\\nread the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable\\nlack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the really\\nsturdy, somewhere in Chronicles.\\n\\tThe point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith\\nof Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vital\\nbeliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned -\\nthe Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church\\norganization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the\\nlived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one\\nhopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studies\\nin the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading.\\n\\tFollowing up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I \\nwould even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the\\nchristian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing\\nthe nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction into\\nthe christian faith was brought about [after grace] through reading\\nGraham Greene: _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of Gerard\\nManley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greene\\'s _Monsignor\\nQuixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian,\\nbut such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly,\\nI often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after\\nreading many parts of the Bible. And that after all is what being\\na Christian is all about: letting your soul and your life be, in\\nsome way, directed towards the infinite, represented to us by\\nthe person of Jesus Christ.\\n\\nPaul Halsall\\nHalsall@murray.fordham.edu\\n',\n",

Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women \\nposter for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did \\nnot exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I \\nsee that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  \\n\\nLet me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \\nno idea how the human body interacts with it\\'s environment and how that \\nbalance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians \\nwho dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go \\nfrom doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and \\nthen when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling \\nquack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn\\'t help Elaine or Jon\\nbut somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a \\nquack.  \\n\\nI\\'ve been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten \\nyears now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were \\nraised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their \\nfarm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to \\nentering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is \\nabout 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition \\neither tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That\\'s okay because I \\nknow that some of what I\\'m teaching is going to stick and there will be at \\nleast a few \"enlightened\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It\\'s really \\ntoo bad that most U.S. medical schools don\\'t cover nutrition because if \\nthey did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the \\nmedical profession.\\n\\nIn animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \"good\" bacteria after \\nantibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not \\nhave a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \"good\" bacteria is \\nneeded after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all \\nkinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small \\nand large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \\nnonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \\nsystem is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \\nthe pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \\ntoxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \\nthese organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \\nresidence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \\nhappen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\\nSteve got real upset with Elaine\\'s doctor because he was using anti-fungals \\nand vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \\nvitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \\nElaine\\'s doctor a quack.\\n\\nHere is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \\ncalled, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\\nfor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \\nyeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.\\nCandidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it \\nrequires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  \\n\\nCandida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of \\nnormal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing\\nfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral \\ncourse of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain \\nmuch higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in \\nit\\'s food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely \\nsurvives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \\nthe other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \\ndiabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little \\nbuggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but \\nsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \\nmembrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \\nthe candida or not isn\\'t certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on \\nthe skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \"treat\" it.\\nIf it\\'s internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \\nnondiscript.  \\n\\n\\nCandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \\nthe sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \\nvaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \\nususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \\nthey broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \\nresponse will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \\nfrom their diets.  About 30% of all American\\'s die with less Vitamin A than \\nthey were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \\nA does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \\nbarrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \\ninflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \\n\\nWhile diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \\nthis type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \\nknock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \\ncompetition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \\navailable to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \\nuse them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \\nthe anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \\ninflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \\nantibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \\njust as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \\nvaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\\n\\nBut even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by \\nthe excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to \\nreturn after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of \\nthe problem is addressed(lack of a \"good\" bacterial flora in the body and/or \\npoor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective \\ntherapy for candida overgrowth.  From it\\'s name, it is an acid loving \\norganism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not \\ngrow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is \\nthe predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum \\nantibiotics).  \\n\\nIn the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \\nreservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \\nfavorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \\nhumidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \\nminimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \\n\\nIf the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \\nblood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \\nbloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \\noccurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \\nfor occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \\nplace.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \\nbut her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \\nhas told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \\nspecimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \\nfalse positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \\nbasis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it\\'s nice to know that I don\\'t have \\ncolon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \\ndoctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\\n\\nCandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria \\ntend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline \\nduring a woman\\'s period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. \\nVinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal \\nproblems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of \\nLactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of \\nthe purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina \\nproblem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year \\nuntil she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting \\nscripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had \\nthe same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some \\ndigging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she \\nused in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex \\nreturned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \\nGI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \\npatients is a non-existent syndrome.\\n\\nThe nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria \\nwhich is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  \\nIf taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through \\naresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.\\nBut before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system \\nneeds to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and \\nsome of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans \\nare not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of \\nthe population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent \\ndisorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).\\n \\nSome of the above material was obtained from \"Natural Healing\" by Mark \\nBricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human \\nnutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in \\nthe future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely \\nimportant role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in \\nthe body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida \\nblooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate \\nintake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI \\nsystem is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it\\'s not going to out \\ngrow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and \\nfatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check \\nonce carbohydrate is returned to the gut.\\n\\nIf Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, \\nfine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med.

(Much thanks to Jayne K who is\\nalready supporting me with kind words and prayers!)\\n\\nI\\'ve been working at this company for eight years in various\\nengineering jobs.  I\\'m female.  Yesterday I counted and realized that\\non seven different occasions I\\'ve been sexually harrassed at this\\ncompany.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one;\\nsomeone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.\\n\\nI\\'m really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it\\ncould have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.\\n\\nThere was no note.  I do not know if it was:\\n\\n\\t- someone\\'s idea of an innocent joke, that went awry\\n\\t- someone\\'s sick idea of flirting\\n\\t- an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)\\n\\nI dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask\\nme some kind of question, I don\\'t know the answer so I take a military\\nspecification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out\\nfalls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a\\nBible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to\\nCorinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love\\nAssociation?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.\\n\\nI can lock up my desk, but I can\\'t lock up every book I have in the\\noffice.  I can\\'t trust that someone won\\'t shove something into my\\nbriefcase or my coat pocket when I\\'m not looking so that I go home to\\nfind such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone\\nwants to do to my body.\\n\\nTo make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to\\ntreat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for\\nleaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go\\nto the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single\\nperson had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one\\ncould be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my\\nnumber was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a\\nneutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite\\nthe fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being\\nleft in my desk drawer.\\n\\nI need some prayers --- I can\\'t stop crying. I am so deeply wounded\\nthat it\\'s ridiculous.\\n\\nI feel like I\\'m some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to\\nreduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feel\\nlike I\\'m a sub-human piece of garbage that\\'s not worthy of a simple\\nphone call saying \"We\\'re leaving for Mary\\'s lunch a little early so\\nthat Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting...\"\\n\\nPlease pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously\\nturned into something positive.  Please pray that whoever is torturing\\nme so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. Please pray\\nfor my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a\\nwhole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new job\\nin a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such\\nharrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts\\nappropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This\\ncompany, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment\\nisn\\'t tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one\\nfemale engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or\\nthreatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven\\ntimes in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company\\ndo me no good when I\\'m terrified or healing from the latest assault.)\\n\\nAnd please pray that I don\\'t turn into an automaton because of this.\\nThat\\'s my bad habit: \"ignore it and it will go away\", \"you\\'re not worth\\nanyone\\'s time so don\\'t go talking to anyone about this\", \"you\\'re right,\\nyou are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this\\nway\", \"you are just an object\", \"you prostitute your mind to this\\ncompany so why can\\'t others expect you to prostitute your body there as\\nwell?\", \"what makes you think women aren\\'t just possessions, and\\nnothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?\"\\nThis is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major\\ndepressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don\\'t come into\\nmy head and stay there, triggering depression.\\n\\nPlease pray that this latest trauma doesn\\'t come between me and God.\\nIn a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to\\nGod, and it\\'s also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can\\nseparate one mentally from God.  (I know God doesn\\'t drop me from his\\nloving hand, but it\\'s awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the\\nhand, look down, think I\\'m falling and forget that God\\'s still holding\\non to me.)\\n\\nAlthough this probably isn\\'t entirely appropriate for this newsgroup,\\nI really can use the kind of loving support you all provide.  For this\\nreason I hope good Mr. Moderator allows me this latest indulgence.  After\\nall, he\\'s allowed me the thermometer note, and a few other off-the-wall\\ntopics.\\n\\nThanks in advance to everyone for your support and prayers.

But I ask, what holds  \\nsomeone *today* to the belief that any or all of them are correct, except by \\nfaith?\\n\\n[ a couple of paragraphs deleted.  Summary: we ask \"Why does the\\nuniverse exist\" ]\\n\\n= I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely\\n= \\n= 1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?\\n= \\n= and\\n= \\n= 2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?\\n= \\n= It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,\\n= is it a meaningful question, after all?\\n=\\n= I would say it isn\\'t. Consider the following:\\n\\nApparently it *is* for many persons.  Hence, we *have* religions.\\n\\n= The question \"why anything exists\" can be countered by\\n= demanding answer to a question \"why there is nothing in nothingness,\\n= or in non-existence\".  Actually, both questions turn out to be\\n= devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don\\'t exist\\n= don\\'t exist. Tautology at its best.\\n\\nCarefully examine the original question, and then the \"counter-question\". \\nThe first asks \"Why\", while the second is a request for definition.  It \\ndoesn\\'t address why something does or does not exist, but asks to define \\nthe lack of existence.  The second question is unanswerable indeed, for\\nhow do we identify something as \"nothing\" (aren\\'t they mutually exclusive\\nterms)?.  How do we identify a state of non-existence (again, this is\\nnearing the limits of this simple layman\\'s ability to comprehend, and I\\nwould appreciate an explanation). \\n\\nI might add, the worldview of \"Things that exist do, and things that\\ndon\\'t...don\\'t\" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable,\\nas does the theist\\'s belief in God.  It is based on the assumption\\nthat there is *not* a reason for being, something as ultimately\\n(un)supportable as the position of there being a reason.  Its very\\nfoundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there *is* a\\nreason.\\n\\nWe come to this. Either \"I am, therefore I am.\", or \"I am for a reason.\"\\nIf the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are\\nsatisfied, and need not a doctor.  If the latter, your search is just\\nbeginning.  \\n\\n= I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.\\n\\nTime will tell. 8^)\\n\\n= \\n= Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is\\n= Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this\\n= answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is\\n= actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and\\n= them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.\\n\\nAgreed.  It would lead me to question their definition of Christianity as\\nwell.\\n\\n= Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.\\n= This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God\\n= Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,\\n= it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always\\n= existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.\\n\\nThis does not preclude His existence.  It only seeks to identify His\\n*qualities* (implying He exists to *have* qualities, BTW).\\n\\n= The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable\\n= of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not\\n= accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.\\n\\nLike the theist, we come to a statement of faith, for this position assumes \\nthat the evidence at hand is conclusive.  Note, I am not arguing against \\nscientific endeavor, for science is useful for understanding the universe in\\nwhich we exist. But I differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective.  I\\nseek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the\\nCreator.\\n\\nI also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer \"why\".   It\\nappears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool is\\ninadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting\\nthat \\'why\\' is an invalid question does not provide an answer.  \\n\\n= : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \"why\".  That isn\\'t\\n= : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).\\n= \\n= This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \"how\",\\n= not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \"why\"\\n= questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the\\n= supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is\\n= as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.\\n\\nMy apologies.  I was using why as \"why did this come to be\".  Why did\\npre-existence become existence.  Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime.\\n\\nBut we come to the admission that science fails to answer \"Why?\".  Because\\nit can\\'t be answered in the realm of modern science, does that make the\\nquestion invalid?\\n= : I don\\'t believe *any*\\n= : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite\\n= : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.\\n= \\n= This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are\\n= somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians\\n= in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce\\n= they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?\\n\\nI suppose we would do the same thing as when Galileo or Capernicus was \\n*vindicated*  (before someone starts jumping up and down screaming\\n\"Inquisition!\", note I said *vindicated*.

Also, the\\norchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation\\nin the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation\\n--- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be\\nnecessary to go with the briefer options just to \"get \\'em in and get \\'em\\nout\".\\n\\nEach parish is different.

Why did she insist that I not send it ??\\n\\n   Because our society has driven into us that religion is ok to\\npreach, non-religion should be self contained. What a crock of shit.\\nI finally told my sister that I didn\\'t find her way of life attractive.\\nI have seen exactly 0 effort from her on trying to convert me since then.\\n\\n   I\\'m sick of religious types being pampered, looked out for, and WORST\\nOF ALL . . . . respected more than atheists.

I\\'ve got a problem that \\nI need as many people\\'s help from as possible.\\n\\nBefore I go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell\\nyou that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy\\nmeets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....Anyway...\\n\\nOK, I am a 19 year old Sophmore at NCSU. About 10 years ago, my family\\nand I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the\\nstreet, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me...\\nher name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and have\\nbeen writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about\\n2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago. \\n\\nBy the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.\\n\\nOK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming\\nback to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So I\\ndrove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent\\nthe whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though\\nwe had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being\\nin person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met.\\n(She\\'s one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could\\nask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to \\nmention WAY out of my league...although I\\'m  not unattractive mind you), but\\nshe had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family\\nis one of those families who goes to church but that is about the\\nextent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But she\\nknows I am a Christian. \\n\\nWell, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such\\na thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid\\nyou not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.\\n\\nIn out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding\\ndates..(which is true for me, but I know it can\\'t be for her).\\nShe has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended\\nup leaving school....Now we are at the present...\\n\\nLet me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....\\n\\n\\n\"Okay, now I\\'m going to try to explain my life to you. I\\'m not\\ngoing to KU anymore because something just isn\\'t right. College\\njust wasn\\'t clicking with me here. Greek life is really big here and\\nthat just isn\\'t my way. I wasn\\'t taking any classes that truly interested\\nme & i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life. I was\\ninterested in something medical (Physical Therpy) & I love working with \\nkids, but \\'it\\' just didn\\'t work for me at this university. And my parents\\ncould tell.\\n\\n\"So I\\'m working full time at the Bass Store [Bass shoes that is] and now\\nI have a part-time job at a local daycare. I work in the infant room\\nM-W-F. I\\'ve really enjoyed it so far. It spices up my week a little bit and \\nit\\'s great experience.\\n\\n\"As of now, I\\'m not planning on going back to school in the very\\nnear future. The main reason being my indecision on what I want to\\nstudy. But I definatley plan on going back within the next couple of\\nyears. Where? I have no idea--except for one thing, it won\\'t be\\nto Kansas.\\n\\n\"Right noew I\\'m discussing a promotion with my boss and district \\nmanager. It looks like I\\'ll train at the store I work at now for\\nabout 4-6 months as Assistant Manager and when that\\'s done, I\\'ll \\nbasically be given a list of stores (newly or soon to be built) to \\nchose where i would like to manage. I\\'ve pretty much decided on either\\none of the Carolinas (hopeully close to the beach) Wouldn\\'t it\\nbe fun to actually see each other more than once every few years??\\nWhat do you think abou that?

Reproduced without permission.]\\n\\n\\n\\nDigression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors\\n\\nAlthough the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practically\\ntasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle\\nberries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in\\nsuch a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile, \\nMoskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle\\nberry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids \\n(which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste\\nsour as well.\\n\\nMiraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a\\ndiet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin\\npill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such\\nsubstances would taste sweet without providing many calories.\\n\\nA colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries.\\nWe drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tasted\\nextremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  We \\nawoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.\\n\\n[... continued discussion of a couple other taste-altering substances ...]\\n\\n\\nRefs:  \\n\\nBartoshuk, L.M., Gentile, R.L., Moskowitz, H.R., & Meiselman, H.L.

I've been seeing \\nher every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28) \\nand during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every \\n4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period. \\nAs it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that \\nthough I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she \\nmentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13 \\nweeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had \\nan operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no \\nproblems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain \\nin my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very \\ndifficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or \\nmove unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for \\nwhen I do need to go out.) \\n\\nAnyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from \\nthe beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about \\n2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.  \\n(I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating \\nvery much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well \\nnow I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile \\nrelated.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my \\nupper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I \\nwas lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because \\nit started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt  \\nno matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I \\nate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had \\nturned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if \\nI ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it \\nwasn't as much of a problem.\\n\\nSo the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid \\nfatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware \\nof what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have \\nbeen avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat \\nfoods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.  \\n\\nBut doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat \\nexcept fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts, \\nfried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I \\nshould avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only \\nhave one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day ( \\npotatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in \\na little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or \\nsteamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have \\nsome fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if \\nI'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it \\nfrom my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if \\nshe's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her \\nrecommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on \\ncholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She \\noriginally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the \\nentire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I \\nstarted.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and \\nshe's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also \\nasked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them \\nare.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain, \\nand feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did \\nwant to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be \\ntemporary for that one week. \\n\\nWhat I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I \\nwould understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying \\nthat anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she \\nassumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that \\nbecause of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to \\nuse the energy from the food I do eat. \\n\\nAny opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm \\ntruly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet \\nbecause fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few \\nminutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I \\ndon't find any foods satisfying.\\n\\nThanks \\n\\nG\\n\",\n",

UK.\\nSupersedes: <19930322114724@mantis.co.uk>\\nLines: 632\\n\\nArchive-name: atheism/logic\\nAlt-atheism-archive-name: logic\\nLast-modified: 5 April 1993\\nVersion: 1.4\\n\\n                       Constructing a Logical Argument\\n\\nAlthough there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument\\nfound is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\\n\\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\\nargument.\\n\\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\\nthe right tool for the job.\\n\\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\\n\\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\\n\\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\\nthree stages.\\n\\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \\n\\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\\npremises.  If something doesn\\'t seem obvious to you, don\\'t be afraid to\\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you\\'re right, it is obvious\" when\\nyou\\'ve heard the explanation.)\\n\\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\\nvalid inference.\\n\\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\\n\"therefore\".\\n\\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\\n\\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\\n\\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \\nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \\nsometimes a little confusing.\\n\\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\\n\\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\\n or the Son of God.\"\\n\\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \\nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we\\'ll\\ncome to those later.)\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\\n\\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\\nargument.\\n\\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\\nB\".  If we\\'re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\\nstatement is an argument.  If we\\'re trying to establish the truth of B, then\\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\\n\\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\\n -- This is an explanation.\\n\\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\\nconclusion is true.\\n\\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\\n\\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \\ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\\ncarefully.\\n\\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \\nFor example:\\n\\n   All insects have wings (premise)\\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\\n\\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument\\'s premises are false. \\nIf the argument\\'s premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \\nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\\n\\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\\nas in:\\n\\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\\n\\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\\nimplication.\\n\\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \\n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\\n\\nPremise Conclusion Inference\\n   A        B        A=>B\\n----------------------------\\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\\n\\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\\n\\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\\n                             the conclusion must be true.\\n\\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \\nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\\n\\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\\n\\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\\nconvincing.\\n\\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\\nexhaustive.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\\n\\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \\nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\\n\\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\\n\\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\\n\\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \\nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness\\'s\\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\\n\\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\\nthe opponent\\'s particular circumstances.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\\notherwise when you\\'re quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\\n\\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\\nthe opponent\\'s argument.\\n\\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \\nYou\\'re white.\"\\n\\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one\\'s\\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\\n\\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\\n\\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\\n\\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\\n\\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \\nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\\n\\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\\nsuch flood occurred.\"\\n\\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\\nhowever.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\\n\\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \\ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \\nconclusion accepted.  For example:\\n\\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don\\'t find me\\nguilty; I\\'m suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\\n\\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\\n\\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\\n\\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\\n\\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\\n\\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\\n\\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\\n\\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\\nbetween:\\n\\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\\nand\\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\\n computer\"\\n\\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \\nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\\n\\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\\n\\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\\nspecific.  For example:\\n\\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\\ndislike atheists.\"\\n\\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\\n\\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\\n\\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\\ninsincere.\"\\n\\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\\n\\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\\nhasty generalization.\\n\\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\\n\\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\\ncured me of the headache.\"\\n\\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\\natheism for the same reasons.\"\\n\\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\\n\\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\\nconclusion reached.\\n\\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \\nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\\noffice.\"\\n\\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \\nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\\nfor the British Secret Services\\' official ban on homosexual employees. \\nAnother example is the classic:\\n\\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\\n\\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\\n\\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \\nquestion:\\n\\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\\n\\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\\nwhen they ask questions like:\\n\\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\\n\\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\\n\\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\\nor\\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\\n\\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\\n\\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \\nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\\nwith that conclusion.\\n\\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\\n\\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\\nfavourable light.\\n\\nEQUIVOCATION\\n\\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\\n\\nAMPHIBOLY\\n\\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\\n\\nACCENT\\n\\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\\n\\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\\nand\\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\\n\\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\\n\\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\\n\\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \\nlightweight.\"\\n\\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\\n\\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\\n\\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\\n\\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\\n\\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\\n\\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\\neach item.  For example:\\n\\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\\n\\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\\n\\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\\nfirst event.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\\nand we\\'ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\\nlegalize marijuana.\"\\n\\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\\n\\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Isn\\'t history based upon faith?  If so, then isn\\'t the Bible also a form of\\nhistory?\"\\n\\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn\\'t Islam a\\nform of Christianity?\"\\n\\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren\\'t dogs a form of cat?\"\\n\\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\\nimplication given earlier.\\n\\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\\na fallacy.\\n\\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\\nanything about B.\\n\\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\\n\\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\\nbecause it is old, or because \"that\\'s the way it\\'s always been.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\\n\\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\\nthan something else.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\\n\\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\\n\\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\\nargumentum ad crumenam.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\\n\\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\\n\\nBIFURCATION\\n\\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\\nalternatives exist or can exist.\\n\\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\\nquestion.\\n\\nNON SEQUITUR\\n\\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\\n\\nRED HERRING\\n\\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\\nbeing discussed, so that everyone\\'s attention is diverted away from the\\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\\n\\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\\n\\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\\n\\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\\n\\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\\n\\nSTRAW MAN\\n\\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else\\'s position so that it\\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\\nmade.\\n\\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\\n\\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \\ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \\nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\\n\\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \\nanti-cryptography legislation:\\n\\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\\n\\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\\n Martin Luther King.\"\\n\\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\\n\\nTU QUOQUE\\n\\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\\n\\n\"You\\'re just being randomly abusive.\"\\n\"So?  You\\'ve been abusive too.\"\\n\\n\\xff\\n',\n",

It's associated with kings, controls\\nworld commerce, is seated on seven mountains (17:9 -- recall that Rome\\nis traditionally regarded as built on seven hills).

But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction\\n   and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?\\n   What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that\\n   Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?\\n   This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically\\n   stood by the Pope.\\n\\nThe ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This\\nis the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his\\ndeparture from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands\\nfrom *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be\\ndisobeyed.\\n\\nMy own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major\\nway.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it\\nwould be too complex for people to figure out.  I don\\'t view the\\npresent situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated.\\nRun through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the\\nCatholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.\\n\\n   It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is\\n   disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over\\n   authority and discipline.  \\n\\nThe problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic\\nFaith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the\\nCatholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring\\nbishops.  It\\'s basically the Reformation part II.\\n\\nThere is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the\\nshards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the\\nCatholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an\\nhour, probably.\\n\\nTake the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I\\'m reading a book\\non what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio\\nde Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the\\nwake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old\\ncatechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the\\nCatholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He\\ninnoculated the people against what was coming.\\n\\nWell, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came\\nwhen the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope\\nrecovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really\\nwanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence.\\nThe Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.\\n\\nThe injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop\\nwas installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer\\'s\\nclergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New\\nMass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass.\\nThe people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop\\nwas *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of\\nthe secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The\\npriests would just start building new churches; the people were\\ncompletely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the\\nbishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.\\n\\nThe prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to\\ncanon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the\\ntraditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V.\\nNor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.\\n\\nDuring all this process, the people of Campos, not just private\\nindividuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending\\npetitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist\\nbishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome.\\nEventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.\\n\\n   My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:\\n\\n\\t Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms\\n\\t could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that\\n\\t the Pope\\'s position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX\\n\\t don\\'t jointly make such  choice.)\\n\\n   If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.\\n   If I adopt the view that \"I\\'m NOT wrong, I CAN\\'T be wrong, and\\n   there\\'s NO WAY I\\'ll change my mind, YOU must change yours\", that\\n   I\\'ve either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.\\n\\nIf the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end\\nof the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in\\nCatholic theology, and anyone who doesn\\'t go along with it is an\\ninstant non-Catholic.\\n\\nThe problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in\\nthe Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are\\ndoing, they would be shocked!\\n\\n   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \"real\"\\n   traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter\\n   East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body\\nof traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are\\nespecially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional\\ndoctrine is.\\n\\n   I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow\\n   error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`\\n   I may be wrong here, I\\'m not Roman Catholic. :-)\\n\\nThat\\'s heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job\\nsince the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors\\nspread that it\\'s pitiful.\\n\\nInfallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the\\nshort term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In\\nfact, that\\'s what usually happens during a major heresy: large\\nsections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been\\nmuch more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long\\nrun.\\n\\n   What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement\\n   regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how\\n   do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?\\n   Again, I\\'m not trying to be contentions, I\\'m trying to understand.\\n   Since I\\'m Orthodox, I\\'ve got no real vested interest in the outcome,\\n   one way or the other.\\n\\nYes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what\\nis he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of\\nthe Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic\\nschools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for\\nthat professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?\\n\\n   It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the\\n   Pope\\'s commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\\n\\nNot really; start studying the major Catholic theologians of the last\\n300 years.

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and \\nIntensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses \\neach equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin \\nJune 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours \\nper day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.  \\nFellowships available for science and engineering students.

Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \\ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \\nJanuary 1994.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \\nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \\nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM DESIGN\\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \\ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\\n\\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\\nrelatively short time.\\n\\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \\nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \\nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \\nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\\n\\n\\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \\nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\\n\\n\\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\\n\\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\\n\\nSTEVEN BRENER\\t\\t\\t\\tSUSIE BROWN\\nJSTMP\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCarnegie Mellon University, GSIA\\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\\t\\tPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle\\t\\t\\tTelephone: (412) 268-7806\\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\\t\\t\\tFAX:\\t   (412) 268-8163\\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414\\t\\t\\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199\\t\\t\\n\\n############################################################################\\n############################################################################ \\n\\n\\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\\nmail.

He\\'s kept a record of the results, and for over \\n2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief\\nof allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his\\nprogram.\\n\\nIn my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic\\nsymptoms outlined in \\'The Yeast Connection\\' (I agree it is a poorly \\nwritten book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which\\nI never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage\\nof Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can\\nnow sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I\\'m also\\n*greatly* improved in other areas as well.\\n\\nOf course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to\\nmolds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn\\'t take a rocket scientist to figure out that\\nif one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a\\nnatural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you\\nwould have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various\\nsorts, and again, you don\\'t have to be a rocket scientist to realize that\\nsuch toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus\\nsince that\\'s the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000\\nquestion is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was\\nfrom over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the\\nstress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast\\ncolonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since\\ntesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to\\ntake an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively\\nsafe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there\\'s\\nno reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.\\n\\nBTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae\\ntoo deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You\\'ll find\\na lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.\\n\\nIn summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep\\nmedicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly\\nto the party line are academics who haven\\'t been in the trenches long enough\\nactually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my\\nface that there is no evidence of the \\'yeast connection\\', I cannot guarantee\\ntheir safety.

And she hung\\nup. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is\\nthe first time she\\'s ever hung up on someone.)

Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  \\nI BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even \\nafter reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.\\n\\nBut first let me say the following.\\nWe might have a language problem here - in regards to \"faith\" and\\n\"existence\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it\\'s rather pointless\\nto debate the so called \"existence\" of God - and that is not what\\nI\\'m doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\\nbeing. When you say that \"god does not exist\", I also accept this\\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\\nin what follows I will use the phrase \"the existence of God\" in it\\'s\\n\\'usual sense\\' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by \"the existence of\\nGod\".\\n \\nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what\\nWebster says:\\n\\nfaith \\n1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY\\nb  (1): fidelity to one\\'s promises\\n   (2): sincerity of intentions\\n2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God\\n   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion\\nb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof\\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n   (2): complete trust\\n3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system \\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nof religious beliefs\\nsyn see BELIEF\\n\\n\\n\\nOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say\\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\\n\"based upon observation\", I will have to ask \"what observtions are\\nyou refering to?\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \\npartents \"believe in God\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\\nabout the \"existence\" or \"non-existence\" of God requires a leap - and\\nyou have made this leap when you actively say \"I believe that God  \\ndoes/does not exist\". Personally, I think that both statements are\\nmisguided. Arguing over the \"existence\" of God is precisely the wrong way\\nto find Him (and yes, I use \"Him\" because a personal God is the only \\nviable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \"She\" go ahead.

Take the flood, for example, the bible is full of detail,\\n(\"forty days and forty nights\", \"pair of every animal\", etc.), we all\\nknow this is nonsense.  The Koran\\'s description of the same event is\\nso obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as \"A big river \\nflooded for a few days and caused much damage\".  Yes, no contradiction\\nbut also not much fact.\\n\\nThe Koran might be consistent with modern science, but being\\nconsistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that\\ntime, does not seem much of an achievement.\\n\\nThe book concludes by saying something like, the Koran must have had\\ndivine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot\\nof (to us now) ridiculous ideas about the universe, and none of them\\ncan be found in the Koran!  Arguing for the greatness of a book by\\ntalking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme.\\n\\nThe above is, of course, from memory so I may have missed some points.\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\n\\nLeonard               e-mail:  L.Newnham@bradford.ac.uk\\n',\n",

The societies which failed to accept enough\\ninput from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed\\nthemselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the\\nones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit\\nto use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes\\nthus far, or else haven\\'t had enough power for long enough. \\n \\nIn summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new\\ntechnology is really an ancient one.

Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(\\ntoxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well \\nbecause of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got \\ninto Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium \\nwould prevent kidney stone formation.  I\\'m going to state it again here.\\nBut the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 \\nsupplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).\\n\\nVitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams \\nper day).\\n\\n\\t1. Review Article \"Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney \\n\\t   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C\" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.\\n\\t   5(3):110-129(1985).\\n\\nBut glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both \\nglycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this \\nproduction is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, \\nbut to increase your intake of vitamin B6.\\n\\n\\t2. \"Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in \\n\\t    patients with kidney stones\" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)\\n\\t    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary \\n\\t    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.\\n\\n\\t3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria\" Clin. Sci. 38\\n\\t   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day \\n\\t   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.\\n\\nFor gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is \\nrequired for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for \\noxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is \\nquite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.  \\nThe pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% \\nof the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable \\nand the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto \\n6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic \\nacid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the \\nextra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a \\nvery early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. \\nMed. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day \\nincreased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg \\nper day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was \\nincreased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose \\nand 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion \\nbefore supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average \\nbefore supplementation.\\n\\nB6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There \\nare probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don\\'t know about \\nyet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the \\nspeculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must \\nhave an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then \\nexplain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C \\nchallenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your \\nintake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you \\ntake vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient \\nin B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate \\nkidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets \\nabsorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day \\nshowed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309\\n-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase \\nin urinary oxalate excretion.\\n\\n\\tHere are the high oxalate foods:\\n\\n\\t1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.\\n\\t   Contain at least 25mg/100grams\\n\\n\\t2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, \\n\\t   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.\\n\\t   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.\\n\\nIf the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot \\nof latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points \\nout that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your \\nintake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being \\nabsorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn\\'t \\nhave to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for \\nmales and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).\\nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more \\nper day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).  \\n\\nThe USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day \\nfor males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with \\nthis low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 \\nrequirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that \\neither block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 \\nexcretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,\\nisoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to \\nsupplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that \\nincrease the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking \\nbirth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the \\nother drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your \\ndietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone \\nformation should be given B6 supplements.\\n\\nOne other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your \\nCa/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is \\ncalcium-oxalate.\\n\\n\\t4. \"The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of \\npatients with calcium oxalate calculi\"Invest. Urol 10:147(1972)\\n\\n\\t5. \"Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the \\ncrystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium \\ninteraction\"J.

Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987).\\n\\nThere are actually about three times as many articles published in the \\nmedical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone \\nformation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in \\nstating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier \\npost in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me.

I've\\nrefrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with\\nthe OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to say\\nsomething.\\n\\nMany things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightest\\nsuggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the\\nGospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death\\nof Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to break\\ndown these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there\\nis neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  If\\nMoslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't kill\\nthem.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions.\\nThere are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under\\nattack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are\\nliving together peacefully.\\n\\nThe precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two\\ndifferent things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into\\nCanaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have\\npromised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be\\na holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those\\nattacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be\\ndefeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in\\nJoshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was\\npossible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once\\nthat was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were\\nexpected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of\\nagreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted\\nBosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior\\nwould have disqualified this from being a holy war.\\n\\nThe other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by\\nAssyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel\\nfor her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a\\njudgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay\\nof the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because\\nillness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God\\nfor good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn't\\njustify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that\\nin attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as\\n*unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God's\\npeople, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were\\nactually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action.\\nFurthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are\\njudgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, through\\nhis prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets to\\nBosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting,\\nI am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But that\\ndoesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it from\\njudgement.\\n\\nI am particularly concerned about the implications of this issue\\nbecause of current tensions between the West and Moslem-oriented\\nnations.  What we do not need is for Moslems to conclude that\\nChristians think it's OK to kill Moslems.  The implications for the\\nmid-East, and even relations with American Moslems, could be quite\\nserious.\\n\",\n",

She was a cheerful\\n    girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but\\n    one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.\\n\\n    The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on\\n    the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-\\n    nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally\\n    arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and\\n    give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon\\n    on\\tthe  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love\\n    we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to\\n    die rather than commit a mortal sin.\\n\\n    Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy\\n    Eucharist.\\tHer  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father\\'s\\n    absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the\\trest  of  the\\n    day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is\\n    until\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   -4-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.\\n    Thus ended the happiest day of Maria\\'s life.\\n\\n    Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling\\n    little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her\\n    mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband,\\tMaria\\n    took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.\\n    She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the\\n    Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti\\'s, owning\\n    a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other\\n    children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she\\n    did the Holy Will of God.\\n\\n    During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son)\\ttwice\\n    made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On\\n    both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro\\'s\\n    strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she\\n    even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria\\tlived\\n    in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.\\n\\n\\n    On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  \"get  a\\n    handkerchief,\"  as\\the  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath\\n    the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the\\n    baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered\\n    what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a\\n    91/2\"  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told\\n    him she wouldn\\'t go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He\\n    stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia\\n    instantly realized what he was up to. \"No, No, No! Do  not\\ttouch\\n    me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!\" At this point Alessandro\\n    held the knife over Maria\\'s chest, who was now on the floor.\\n\\n    \"Will you or will you not?\" Maria gathered all her energy.\\t\"No I\\n    will  not,\\tAlessandro,  no!\"   She had chosen her martyrdom over\\n    sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the\\n    knife  into   Maria\\'s  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to\\n    his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the\\n    knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying\\n    of the baby Teresa\\ton  the  landing  brought  the\\tattention  to\\n    Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended\\n    and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find\\n    Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.\\n    When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   \"He\\n    wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.\"\\n\\n    The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro\\taway.\\n    As\\tthe  ambulance\\tcarried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd\\n    followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for\\n    poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First\\n    Communion\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   -5-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.\\n    He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  \"Yes.  For the\\n    love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me\\n    in\\tParadise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have.\" Maria\\n    died at about three o\\'clock.\\n\\n    Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria\\'s  death  but\\n    because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in\\n    prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-\\n    ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of\\n    a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to\\n    him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God\\'s par-\\n    don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony\\n    in\\tMaria\\'s  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,\\n    on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the\\n    first mother ever to be present at her daughter\\'s canonisation.\\n\\n    May St. Maria Goretti help\\tus  to\\tbe  pure  and  grant  us  the\\n    strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.\\n\\n    Saint Maria Goretti, pray for us.\\n\\n\\n    by Brendan Arthur\\n\\n-- \\nInternet: simon@giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au  \\nViva Cristo Rey !!

Bede is a great\\nscholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived\\n673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of\\nthe word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well\\nestablished before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth\\nof anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely\\nthat his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that\\nthere had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name,\\nand the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance\\n(surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should\\nhave a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf\\nconvincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does\\nnot make it more so.\\n\\nAssuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the\\nChristian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some\\ncenturies before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots.\\nIt would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians\\nand beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every\\nspring, called it by the name that to them meant simply \"Spring\\nFestival.\"\\n\\nHowever, Bede\\'s is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J\\nKnoblech, in \"Die Sprach,\" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5\\n(Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:\\n\\nAmong Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast\\nof the Resurrection was known as \"hebdomada alba\" (white week),\\nsince the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their\\nwhite baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was\\nreferred to simply as \"albae.\" Translaters rendering this into\\nGerman mistook it for the plural of \"alba,\" meaning \"dawn.\" They\\naccordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for\\n\"dawn.\" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.\\n\\n Yours,\\n James Kiefer\\n\\n\\n[No, I\\'m not interested in restarting discussions of the propriety\\nof celebrating Easter.

Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\\nresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\\nclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\\nBecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\\n\\nAlthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\\nMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\\nthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\\nin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\\ninterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\\n\\nThe assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\\nChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\\nrequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\\nare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\\nmother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\\ntook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\\nallow her flesh to rot in the grave.\\n\\nOne last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\\non the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\\ndid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\\nThe dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\\nwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\\ntheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make\\nsense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the\\ncross, would want to share in his death.\\n\\nBrian Finnerty\\n\",\n",

One\\nof the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is only\\none area in which disciples stand out from \"Christians\".  Also, another\\npart of unity is a common depth of conviction.  I\\'ve also been a part of\\nsome \"Christian\" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between\\nchurches and saw that those churches had one thing involved:  a lack of\\nconviction about everything they believed.  That was why they could be\\nunified, they didn\\'t care about the truth but delighted in getting along\\ntogether.\\n\\n>The problem here in The Netherlands is that there are two other churches\\n>(denominations) with the same characteristics.

Or is this definitely an untolerable situation\\n>  according to the Scriptures?\\n\\nAccording to the Scriptures, splits and differences of opinion are going\\nto be there.  As per a previous note, I mentioned that there are those\\nwho teach falsely by many means.  There are also differences of opinion\\nand belief.  However, Scripture states:  \\n   In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your\\nmeetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that when\\nyou come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some\\nextent I believe it.  No doubt there have to be differences among you to\\nshow which of you have God\\'s approval (1 Corinthians 11:17-19).\\n\\nHow will God show his approval?  By fruitfulness (see Acts 2:47), but\\nbefore that, there are these qualities:\\n   devotion to the apostles teaching\\n   fellowship\\n   communion\\n   filling with awe for God\\n   all having everything in common.\\n   glad and sincere hearts\\n   praising God\\n   enjoying the favor of the people\\nAll these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47.  God also shows that those who\\nhave these qualities are persecuted.  Look at Stephen, \"a man full of\\nfaith and of the Holy Spirit\" (Acts 6:5) who was later stoned (Acts\\n7:54-60).  \\n\\n>- can one say that only one of these three churches is the\\n>  true church of Jesus Christ?\\n\\nOne can say that a church is the true church only if that church is\\nperfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.  I\\nhave yet to find that, but the closest one I\\'ve found is the Boston\\nChurch of Christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors\\npointed out and corrected.  It is also the only one I\\'ve seen which is\\ntotally sold out to God.\\n\\n>\\n>A problem closely related to these question is:\\n>- can we cooperate with other Christians - from these two churches - \\n>  before there is a unity? This question is especially important\\n>  for those who think that only one church can be the \"true one\".\\n>\\nAs for cooperation, that can always occur.  Unity, on the other hand may\\nnever occur.  As for those who think about only one church being the\\n\"true one\", I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there are\\ndisciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they\\nwill not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, I\\'ve heard\\nnumerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there\\nthat are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them\\nany less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that they\\'ve ever run\\ninto someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement.\\nI know I haven\\'t.\\n\\n>Maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you.\\n>For your information: we have a lot of organizations here which\\n>are founded by people of one specific church and whose members\\n>are all members of that church.

A clique is a group which\\nruns around together to some extent exclusively.  This causes problems\\nin fellowship and causes divisions.  I would not say at all that this is\\nsomething \"correct\" for a church/group to do for any reason.  In one of\\nthe churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique of\\npeople who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational\\nheads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of\\nthe committees and seldom were voted out of office without another\\noffice being \"opened up\" so that they would have to step right back in.\\nTheir degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he\\nnearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish he\\nwould\\'ve since they still have no clue about what it means to be a\\ndisciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be\\nbroken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such division\\nwithin.

Did I misunderstand?\\n\\nReading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in\\nthe world.  Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of\\nreligion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a \"real\"\\nstory (that is, a bigger headline).\\n\\nLet\\'s back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the\\nvarious targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the\\nSeptuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the\\nstandard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has\\nobvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy.\\nThese passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and\\nto the Septuagint.\\n\\nNow, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars:\\nfirst, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are\\nvariant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to \"fixing\"/predating\\nthe various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of\\nmy knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and\\nhave little theological import.\\n\\nThe dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of\\nIsaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There\\nis also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no\\nsign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the\\nseptuagint).

No\\n: reasonable alternative exists.\\n\\nI would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime; \\ncauses precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be\\nan answer to \"how\" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from \\n\"nothing\", science has some good candidates for an answer.\\n\\nI have always wondered why Christians use the \"There are questions\\nscience (or atheism) cannot answer\" argument; I hope this is the\\nappropriate group to ask this question.\\n\\nThe most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the\\nuniverse exist, or anything, for that matter?\\n\\nI think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely\\n\\n1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?\\n\\nand\\n\\n2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?\\n\\nIt is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,\\nis it a meaningful question, after all?\\n\\nI would say it isn\\'t. Consider the following:\\n\\nA die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt\\none\\'s very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else -\\nI cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me -\\ncan I ever be sure I exist?\\n\\nHowever, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone\\ninsert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )\\n\\nA being that does not exist cannot doubt one\\'s existence.\\nA being that does exist can doubt one\\'s existence, but this would be\\npointless - the being would exist anyway.\\n\\nLet us return to the original question: why? A being that does not\\nexist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being\\nis not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let\\nus assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity\\npostulate). The question \"why anything exists\" can be countered by\\ndemanding answer to a question \"why there is nothing in nothingness,\\nor in non-existence\". Actually, both questions turn out to be\\ndevoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don\\'t exist\\ndon\\'t exist. Tautology at its best.\\n\\nI seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.\\n\\nSome Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is\\nHimself the existence. However, I see several problems with this\\nanswer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is\\nactually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and\\nthem. This is pantheism, not Christianity.\\n\\nAnother answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.\\nThis sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God\\nHimself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,\\nit can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always\\nexisted. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.\\nThis argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists,\\nand from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence.\\nI think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.\\n\\nThe best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable\\nof understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not\\naccept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.\\n\\nThe second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing?\\nbelongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the\\nquestion can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have\\nsuggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge\\nfrom vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent\\nHawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe,\\nWorld Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more\\nappropriate for discussions like this.\\n \\n: As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \"why\".  That isn\\'t\\n: true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).\\n\\nThis is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \"how\",\\nnot why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \"why\"\\nquestions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the\\nsupernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is\\nas appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.\\n \\n: I believe the \"genetic code\" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes,\\n: but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining, \\n: reproducing life, *ever*.  (I\\'ve never been much of a prophet, though. I\\n: can\\'t even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don\\'t believe *any*\\n: technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite\\n: having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.\\n\\nThis opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are\\nsomehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians\\nin general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce\\nthey have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?\\n\\nThere is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created,\\nalthough not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolution\\ncontain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, although\\ntheir code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent book\\n\\nSteven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. Jonathan\\nCape, London 1992.\\n\\nArtificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no \\nspark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do not\\nviolate any physical laws as we know them. \\n\\n: You don\\'t mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your\\n: research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you\\n: really have nothing to worry about, eh?\\n\\nExactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelical\\natheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to \\nfind peace in religions must be allowed to gather together.

Digital immortality.\\n\\nThe basic idea behind \"digital immortality\" is that computer networks   \\nare here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them\\nwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the\\nartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they\\'ll be put in different\\nformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they\\'ll be\\nthere...and someone will dig them up.  \\n \\nIf that doesn\\'t interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique\\nand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes\\nand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang\\nas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is \\nbreathed into your work...and by merit of it\\'s stimulus, it will \\ntravel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.\\n \\nSpectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and \\nlet the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own\\ncopies of the images to look at when you\\'ve got the gumption...\\nthat\\'s what they\\'re here for.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWHERE?             \\n\\nOTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  \\n \\n \\t141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tsunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite \\n\\t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)\\n\\nMerely \"anonymous FTP\" to either site on Internet and change to the\\nappropriate directory.  Don\\'t forget to get busy and use the \"bin\"\\ncommand to make sure you\\'re in binary.\\n\\nOTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North\\nAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply of\\nOTIStuff...\\n\\tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines\\n\\tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n \\nHOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?\\n              \\nWhat happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   \\nphoto, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put\\nit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me\\n(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,\\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\\nare also welcome.\\n\\nOTIS\\' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \\nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \\nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \\nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\\ntougher to find.  If you can\\'t find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \\nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \\nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \\n\\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \\n\\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we\\'ll\\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \\ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \\nemailing).\\n\\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\\ncopies to:\\n\\nThe OTIS Project\\nc/o Ed Stastny\\nPO BX 241113\\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\\n\\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \\nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \\nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \\ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\\ndirectory where it\\'s finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \\n \\nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\\ncontact me and we\\'ll arrange things.\\n\\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\\nThis is good for people who don\\'t have direct access to encoders or FTP,\\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\\nJPG.  If you can\\'t...we can convert from most formats...we\\'d just rather\\nnot have to.\\n\\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\\ncan stand.  Even if you don\\'t have stuff to contribute, you can send\\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \\nget a slab-o-OTIS.\\n\\nAs of 04/21/93, we\\'re at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \\nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISTRIBUTION?\\n\\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \\non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \\nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \\n \\nIt would also be nice if you\\'d send me a note when you did post images\\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\\n\\nIt\\'s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\\nkeen of you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUSE?\\n\\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\\nyou\\'ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \\nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \\nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \\nArtists name.  If permission isn\\'t explicitly given, then you\\'ll have \\nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\\'ll get in contact with the artist for \\nyou, or give you their contact information.\\n \\nWhen you DO use permitted work, it\\'s always courteous to let the artist\\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\\ncompensation for their files.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNAMING IMAGES?\\n\\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci\\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something\\nlike:\\n \\n\\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\\n\\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\\nremain intact on all systems.  \\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \\n\\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\\n\\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\\ncase they\\'d like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\\naddress or other information you\\'d like people to know.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHMMM?!\\n\\nThat\\'s about it for now.  More \"guidelines\" will be added as needed.\\nYour input is expected.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  \\n \\t     (a sumerian deity) or it\\'s followers, be they pope, priest,\\n\\t     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations\\n\\t     however.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original \\n \\t     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.  \\n\\t     It\\'s possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone\\n\\t     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  \\n    \\t     Unless you\\'ve given permission for that, it\\'s illegal.  OTIS\\n\\t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights\\n\\t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to \\n\\t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed \\n\\t     electronically.  If you don\\'t want your images distributed     \\n\\t     all-over, don\\'t upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is\\n\\t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or\\n\\t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not \\n\\t     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        \\n\\t     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific\\n\\t     permission for this sort of usage.  \\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRemember, the operative term is \"stimulate\".

Wouldn\\'t that imply that God is STILL\\n>pouring out new revelation to us?  I know that some people will feel\\n>that is okay, and some will not.  The concept of a closed canon would\\n>certainly cast a shadow on contemporary prophets.  On the other hand,\\n>an open canon seems to be indicated sometimes.\\n\\nThere are a lot of people running around saying \"God told me this\" and \\n\"God told me that\" these days.  Some people really have heard God, and others\\nheard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  He\\nsaid someone told him, \"The Lord gave me a song.\"  He said that it was\\nthe worst song he had ever heard.\\n\\n\"I know why he gave you that song,\" Murillo said, \"He didn\\'t want it anymore.\"\\n\\nBut God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to the\\nidea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spirit\\nin the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first\\nto put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the one\\nwe have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.  \\n\\nMany prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures.\\nFor example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an \"M\" who\\nprophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecy\\nhe gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies\\nbecause the king complained before he heard the prophecy, \"He never prophesies\\nanything good about me.\"  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his \\nlifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples.\\nBarnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an \\napostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two of\\nAgabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophet\\nbefore he gave them.  \\n\\nSo prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it \\nScripture.  \\n\\n>Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new\\n>but rather an inspired translation of scripture.  Is it right to call\\n>that prophecy?  Misleading?  Wouldn\\'t that be more having to do with\\n>knowledge?\\n\\nI don\\'t know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with \\nprophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also \\nsimilar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets prophecies\\nin a seemingly prophetic way, for example, \"And his bishoprick let another\\ntake\" concerning Judas office.\\n\\nA clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying about\\nwhat will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joel\\nabout the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scriptural\\nprophecy can be used in later prophecy.  \\n\\nSometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge,\\nbut gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdom\\ncan overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.  \\nInterpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are often\\nconsidered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a \\nbit hazy.  Imho, it doesn\\'t usually matter that much if we are able to\\nlabel a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the \\nSpirit, and use them according to His leading.\\n\\nLink Hudson.\\n',\n",

Shaz....\\n\\n[I\\'m not sure quite what you mean by many different versions.\\nThe primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style\\nof the translation.  It\\'s pretty unusual to see significant\\ndifferences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying\\ntext.  That\\'s because before printing, manuscripts were copied by\\nhand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts\\naround that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the\\noriginal, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are\\ngenerally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are\\nsomething like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved,\\nbut with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don\\'t think there\\'s\\nmuch uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians\\nbelieve that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of\\ntranslating is free of error.  But I also don\\'t think there\\'s\\nenough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that\\nit has much practical effect.\\n\\nWhether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot\\ntopic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it\\n(though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details\\nthat don\\'t affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there\\nbeing multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in\\nall the versions.  I\\'m surprised to find a reference to this on the\\ntitle page though.  What version are you talking about?  I\\'ve been\\nreferring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get\\nreferenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been\\neditions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes\\neverything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into\\nsingle narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor\\nobjects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible\\nhas long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making\\neditions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions\\nthat are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from\\na variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine\\none of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all\\ninaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it\\'s not any edition\\nthat\\'s widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is.\\n(Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It\\'s been alleged that a few\\ntranslations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize\\ninconsistencies.

Introns are removed\\nby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,\\nif introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have\\nrequired _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,\\nsince sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are\\nconserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a\\ntrace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and\\nthese are not found in or near intron sequences. \\n\\nI seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and\\ngenetics before posting \"theological arguments\" like this. \\nTry Watson\\'s Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish\\n& Baltimore\\'s Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.\\n\\n: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does\\n: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a\\n: theological perspective -- my own.

It *does*\\n>imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are\\n>incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and\\n>which are not.)\\n\\nTo start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So\\nthere\\'s a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a\\ngiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely\\nand makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums\\nof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other\\nhand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which\\neventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies\\ncontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  \"You people call\\nTHIS science?\"   (My opinion, for what it\\'s worth, is that one sees both\\nthese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  \\n\\nSome subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor\\nappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don\\'t believe it is \\never possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  \\n\\n\\nMy second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make\\nextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using\\nmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this\\nis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach\\ntheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.\\n\\nWithin mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before\\nthe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is\\nfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later \\nmathematicians did prove them, of course.)  \\n\\nI think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not\\nso much a matter of determining what is true and what\\'s not  as it is a \\nmatter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of \\nincompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to \\nobjectively convince others of the validity of one\\'s results is an\\nessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step \\nof the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward \\nthat goal then one is not doing science.)\\n\\nWhen a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and\\nseems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also\\nworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further\\ninvestigation.  \\n\\nIn article <C53By5.HD@news.Hawaii.Edu> I wrote: \\n> Namely, is there really justification for the belief that\\n> science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches?  \\n\\nAdmittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable\\namount of effort in a \"serious scholarly investigation\" such as I\\nsuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately \\nspecific question to try and answer.  \\n\\nThe \"science\" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science \\ncurrently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  \\nI certainly wasn\\'t thinking of some idealized science or the mere use \\nof \"reason and observation.\"\\n\\nOne thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether\\nin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced\\npractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  \\n\\nSince Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with\\nthe study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there \\nis any existing research related to this question.  \\n\\n--\\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \\nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \\n\\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet\\n',\n",

In fact, throughout their\\nministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were\\npresent when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days\\nlater, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of\\nthe other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was\\nstill unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There\\nwas no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else\\nwas laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed\\nthat Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their  \\npreaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently \\nconsidered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind\\nby several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the\\napostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down\\nin the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the\\nauthenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of\\nthe assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.\\n\\n\\tHope this helps--I would welcome anyone who has more information to\\n\\tadd to what I\\'ve said.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t- Mike Walker\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  mdw33310@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  (Univ. of Illinois)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  ]\\n',\n",

       " u'From: mcelwre@cnsvax.uwec.edu\\nSubject: NATURAL ANTI-cancer/AIDS Remedies\\nOrganization: University of Wisconsin Eau Claire\\nLines: 224\\n\\n\\n\\n     The biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so EXTREMELY high and\\nincreasing is that NATURAL methods of treatment and even diagnosis are still\\nbeing SYSTEMATICALLY IGNORED and SUPPRESSED by the MONEY-GRUBBING and POWER-\\nMONGERING \"medical\" establishment.\\n     Some examples of very low cost NATURAL ANTI-cancer Remedies are listed in\\nthe following article:\\n\\n\\n                          NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES\\n                                 A 3RD OPINION\\n          \\n               ( Some of these Remedies also work against AIDS. )\\n\\n\\n          DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources \\n          that have shown themselves to be reliable.  The compiler of \\n          this list is NOT a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his \\n          First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the \\n          subjects of his choice. \\n\\n\\n          ( MOST of these Remedies can be found in ANY Grocery Store.  \\n          MOST of the rest of them can be found in ANY Health Food \\n          Store.  What is important is HOW they are used, and what \\n          else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. )\\n\\n\\n          (1) THE 7-DAY FAST. \\n               1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind \\n          at a time, preferably grapes. \\n               2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half \\n          raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape \\n          clean the intestinal linings. \\n               3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice \\n          you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune \\n          juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from \\n          concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to \\n          your home bathroom.) \\n               4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and \\n          dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS \\n          CONTAIN LAETRILE.). \\n               5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from \\n          two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and \\n          add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).  \\n          Drink one glass per hour.\\n          [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day \\n          every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH \\n          PULP.] \\n               6th day: Same as 5th day. \\n               7th day: Same as 6th day. \\n               All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each \\n          day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements, \\n          plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. \\n\\n          (2) THE GRAPE DIET. \\n               Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to \\n          8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the \\n          six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. \\n      \\n          (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.\\n               Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple \\n          cider \"flavored\" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a \\n          glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.  \\n          Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a \\n          week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal \\n          healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially \\n          effective against those types of cancer that resemble a \\n          FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections. \\n        \\n          (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]\\n               Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level \\n          comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.  \\n          Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely \\n          dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt \\n          (regular salt won\\'t work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda. \\n               Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising \\n          your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your \\n          stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down, \\n          chomping your teeth together, etc.. \\n               Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes \\n          the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the \\n          book \"Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2\", by Frances Nixon, 1973. \\n               PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should \\n          prepare it and drain it.\\n          For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away \\n          from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly \\n          expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt \\n          other people\\'s fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at \\n          least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.  \\n          (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take \\n          a 2-Billion-bacteria \"Acidophilus\" capsule, which is also an \\n          EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF \"A.I.D.S.\" \\n          (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the \\n          digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune \\n          system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal \\n          bacteria, it may also be a CURE for \"Lyme disease\".]\\n          Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder \\n          storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during \"Major\" or \\n          \"Minor Periods\" as listed in the \"Solunar Tables\" published \\n          bimonthly in \"Field & Stream\" Magazine, (because of the \\n          measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields \\n          present at those times).\\n          Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year. \\n       \\n          (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES: \\n       \\n               For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the \\n               affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons \\n               per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for \\n               about 2 months. \\n        \\n               D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to \\n               perform NORMAL cell functions. \\n\\n               ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.  \\n               To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.  \\n               To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per \\n               day.\\n               [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.  \\n               IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer \\n               cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile \\n               into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is \\n               ALSO present in the digestive system.)] \\n\\n               ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include \\n               Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most \\n               people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A \\n               (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide \\n               Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up \\n               to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-\\n               toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime \\n               will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types), \\n               suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes, \\n               prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not \\n               cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST \\n               \"A.I.D.S.\", which is really a form of cancer similar to \\n               leukemia.]  (See the book \"Life Extension\", by Durk \\n               Pearson and Sandy Shaw.) \\n\\n               HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3% \\n               hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably \\n               DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day, \\n               hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.  \\n               Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers \\n               several times per day.\\n               Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good \\n               daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants \\n               described above. \\n\\n               VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and \\n               much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA \\n               doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources. \\n\\n               Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell) \\n               NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on \\n               and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an \\n               aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-\\n               radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with \\n               daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH \\n               magnetic fields. \\n\\n               Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES \\n               can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well \\n               as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics \\n               Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos \\n               of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays! \\n\\n               INTERFERON tablets.\\n\\n               TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho). \\n           \\n               HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical \\n               problems (even drug addiction!). \\n\\n               50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure \\n               prostate trouble. \\n\\n               This list is NOT exhaustive. \\n\\n\\n          The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-\\n          DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent \\n          and cure many other medical problems including heart-\\n          diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work \\n          effectively. \\n\\n          Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these \\n          remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send \\n          a strong message to one\\'s subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it \\n          to CURE the cancer. \\n\\n          In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer, \\n          then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies \\n          described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast), \\n          BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations \\n          and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer \\n          treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!]. \\n          \\n          \\n          DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources \\n          that have shown themselves to be reliable.

Now, this\\nis not what I had to come to talk about.  But every time I tried to \\nbring up the subject of Judaism, they would condemn Jews for Jesus\\nand admonish me against converting to Judaism, \"because it involves\\ntoo much study and effort.\"  And I did not even raise the prospect, nor\\ntry to convert them to the truth of Christ!  There was certainly no\\nJewish proselytism going on there.\\n\\nAnd again, last November I toured a \"traditional\" Jewish synagogue and was\\nsubjected to a 30-minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity in\\ngeneral.

While\\nthere is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no\\ninjunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But\\nsince public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather\\nkeep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.\\n\\nBut there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants\\nexplicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the\\nceremony itself.\\n\\n| Granted, the Gnostic \"Christians\"\\n| had their secret rituals, but these seem to have been taken entirely\\n| from pagan pre-Christian mystery religions.\\n\\nThere are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter.\\nOne must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was\\nwritten by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret\\ninformation to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that\\nthose apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve\\n(Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).\\n\\nIrenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and\\nbishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He\\nclaims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the\\napostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which\\nwe today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius,\\nop. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a*\\ngnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.\\n\\nWritings dealing with Jesus\\' post-resurrection teachings emphasize\\nsecrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching\\ncertain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a\\ndialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter\\'s response is \"You seem\\nto me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you\\nboth whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not\\npermitted to me now to disclose these things to you\" (_Clementine\\nRecognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_\\nit is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but\\ncan be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.\\n\\nNow one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I\\ndon\\'t intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I\\nbelieve that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of\\nearly Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.\\n\\n| Neither New Testament\\n| Christianity nor Biblical Judaism made a secret of their practices.\\n\\nBut if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect\\nto read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of\\nMormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on\\ntemple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in\\ntemples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that\\nworship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all*\\npractices which might have taken place, and that absence of such\\ndescriptions proves they did not exist?\\n\\nMormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from\\nwhich I have taken a few:\\n\\n1. \"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of\\nheaven, but to them it is not given\" (Matt. 13:11).\\n\\n2. \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\"\\n(Matt. 19:11).\\n\\n3. \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them\\nnow\" (John 16:12).\\n\\n4. \"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs,\\nbut I shall shew you plainly of the Father\" (John 16:25).\\n\\n5. \"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\"\\n(1 Cor. 3:1-2).\\n\\n6. \"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ...\\ncome unto you and speak face to face\" (2 Jn. 1:12).\\n\\n(Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)\\n\\nAgain, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe\\nthey serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught\\nwere actually taught openly.\\n\\n| I have heard that Joseph Smith took the entire\\n| practice (i.e. both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual)\\n| from the Freemasons.  Anybody in the know have any authoritative\\n| information on whether or not this claim is true?\\n\\nHistorically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple\\nendowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons.\\nThere is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not\\nchange after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had\\nample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his\\ntime and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific\\nconnection has yet been established.\\n\\nMy conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite\\ntranscriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe\\nthat the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As\\nour moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the\\nrecent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who\\ncharge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have\\nadequate knowledge of the rites in question.\\n-- \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n         Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City\\n                    jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

[*]\\n\\nSince your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded\\nfor a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two\\'s rising edge has a slope\\nof 1/4. (I\\'m also using Mode X, 320x240).\\n\\nI\\'ve run into two problems; I\\'m sure that other readers have tried this\\nbefore, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:\\n\\n1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a\\npacked->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the \"jaggies.\"  I\\'m\\nnow considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).\\nIs it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,\\nthus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?\\n\\n2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort\\nthe original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.\\nHas anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared\\nshape?\\n\\nCurrently I take:\\n\\n  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\\n 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32\\n 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48\\n 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\\n\\nand produce:\\n            \\n             1  2  3  4\\n33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8\\n49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12\\n            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16\\n                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32\\n                                    61 62 63 64\\n\\nLine 1 follows the slope.

I\\'ve decided that this\\napproximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough\\ndistance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in\\na real perspective drawing.\\n\\nHopefully the \"context\" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches\\nhanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.\\n\\nThanks in advance for any help.\\n\\n-- \\nTill next time,                \\\\o/   \\\\o/\\n                                V \\\\o/ V     email:pinky@tamu.edu\\n<>  Sam  Inala  <>                 V\\n\\n',\n",

Otherwise we would have the book\\nof Enoch in the canon (as Dave noted).  One can say that the \\napocrypha are not quoted by Christ.  \\n\\nDave also writes:\\n\\nIII. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because\\n \\t\\tthey teach doctrines contrary to the (uncontroverted)\\n \\t\\tparts of the canon.\\n \\n \\tthen I answer: \\n \\t\\tThese is a logically invalid *a priori*. \\n \\t\\tBesides, we are talking about OT texts- \\n \\t\\twhich in many parts are superceded by the NT\\n \\t\\t(in the Xtian view). Would not this same\\n \\t\\tprinciple exclude _Ecclesiastes_?\\n \\t\\tThis principle cannot be consistently applied.\\n \\nI have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one\\nvoice, and he does not contradict himself.  \\n\\nThe ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired\\nby the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more\\nguided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decided\\nthat the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books\\nsuch as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example,\\nthe Lutheran hymn \"Now Thank We All Our God\" quotes a passage\\nfrom this book.\\n\\nThe deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church\\'s\\nhistory.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the\\nrest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added these\\nbooks was guided by the Spirit in so doing.

Basically it changes things\\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\\n   other users.\\n\\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs!

Societal morality is necessarily\\nvery crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what\\nis necessary to keep that society going  - and often it\\'s a little\\nover-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different\\nthing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),\\nbut is stronger.

If society is who should\\nmake the rules, that\\'s yet another.

The hard trick is to recognise when\\nit is, and equally importantly, when it isn\\'t.\\n\\n# and only interfering when it\\'s truly\\n#>necessary.\\n#\\n#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?\\n\\nIMO, it isn\\'t often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various\\nkinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive \\nthe right to interfere is a difficult question - it\\'s a sort of\\nliar\\'s paradox: \"force is necessary for freedom\".   One possible justification\\nis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn\\'t object if\\ntheir own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn\\'t arise if\\nwe don\\'t actively wish to take way anyone\\'s freedom.\\n#\\n#  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem\\n#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem\\n#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.\\n#\\n#They see the need for a \"justice\" system.  How can we even define that term?\\n\\nOnly by consensus, I guess.\\n\\n#  Thus you\\n#>get a situation where \"The law often allows what honour forbids\", which I\\'ve\\n#>come to believe is as it should be.  \\n#\\n#I admit I don\\'t understand that statement.\\n\\nWhat I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may\\nalso be seen as immoral.

Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n|> \\n|> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading\\n|> companies,\\n|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,\\n|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI\\'s uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities.

Indeed, they would generally admit that they could conceivably\\nbe wrong, e.g. that in this case, a blood tranfusion might not turn out to \\nbe necessary after all.  However, the doctors would have enough confidence\\nand conviction to claim, out of genuine concern, that is IS necessary.  As\\nfallible human beings, they must acknowledge the possibility that they are\\nwrong.  However, they would also say that such doubts are not reasonable,\\nand stand by their convictions.\\n\\n-- \\nVirgilio \"Dean\" Velasco Jr, Department of Electrical Eng\\'g and Applied Physics \\n\\t CWRU graduate student, roboticist-in-training and Q wannabee\\n    \"Bullwinkle, that man\\'s intimidating a referee!\"   |    My boss is a \\n   \"Not very well.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\\n        2. X terminals\\n        3. NeXT\\n        4. Silicon Graphics\\n        5. IBM RS/6000\\n\\t6. Other stuff\\n\\n    1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\\n\\n\\tIf you\\'ve got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard\\n\\t(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you\\'re going to have a hard time finding\\n\\ta vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation\\n\\truns the X window system, you\\'re in luck.  You can buy a cheap used\\n\\tPC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable\\n\\tto your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read\\n\\tthe serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.\\n\\n\\tThe two main programs I\\'ve found to do this are KT and A2X.\\n\\n\\ta2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and\\n\\teven moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server\\n\\textension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your\\n\\tserver can do this, run \\'xdpyinfo\\' and see if any of these strings\\n\\tappear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn\\'t have this,\\n\\tyou may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,\\n\\tor bugging your vendor.\\n\\n\\tkt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.\\n\\tAnother program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven\\'t seen it.\\n\\n\\tBoth a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.\\n\\n    2. X terminals\\n\\n\\tAlso, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use\\n\\tPC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all\\n\\tset.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the\\n\\ttrouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add\\n\\textra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around\\n\\tfor the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.\\n\\n    3. NeXT\\n\\n\\tNeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop\\n\\tBus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they\\n\\twere cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of\\n\\tupgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!\\n\\n    4. Silicon Graphics\\n\\n\\tSilicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and\\n\\tbeyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don\\'t\\n\\tbelieve this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It\\'s not\\n\\tpossible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by\\n\\tupgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more\\n\\tdetails.\\n\\n    5. IBM RS/6000\\n\\n\\tIBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||\\n\\tUnfortunately, you can\\'t just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||\\n\\tcable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||\\n\\tsmaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||\\n\\tit or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||\\n\\tworks.  However, they don\\'t want me to redistribute it.  I\\'ve been  ||\\n\\ttold Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||\\n\\tanything new, please send me e-mail.\\t\\t\\t\\t    ||\\n    \\n    6. Other stuff\\n\\n\\tSome vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)\\n\\tsupport some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your\\n\\tqueries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can\\n\\tget sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either\\n\\tfrom the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in\\n\\tluck.  Contact the companies for more details.\\n\\n\\nApple Adjustable Keyboard\\n    Apple Computer, Inc.\\n    Sales offices all over the place.\\n\\n    Availability: February, 1993\\n    Price: $219\\n    Supports: Mac only\\n\\n    Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The\\n    keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate\\n    backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are\\n    arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.\\n\\n    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.\\n    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.\\n\\n    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not\\n    directly attachable to the keyboard.\\n\\n    As soon as soda comes back up, I\\'ll have a detailed blurb from\\n    TidBITS available there.\\n\\n\\nFlexPro Keyboard\\n    Key Tronic\\n    Phone: 800-262-6006\\n    Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299\\n    Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops\\n\\n    Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)\\n    Price: $489 (?)\\n    Supports: PC only (highly likely)\\n\\n    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.

You can rearrange the three\\n    sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).

What\\'s up?\\n| \\n| This is a frequently asked question.  Every time it arises, it causes\\n| months of debate.  So let me see if I can answer you directly.\\n| Basically it\\'s because the Law was given to Moses as part of a\\n| specific covenanent with the Jews.  Most of us aren\\'t Jews, so we\\n| aren\\'t part of that covenant.  There was an argument early in\\n| Christian history about whether the Mosaic laws should apply to\\n| Gentiles who became Christians.  You can see the account of this\\n| debate in Acts 15.  The main question there was circumcision, but\\n| keeping the Sabbath would be part of it as well.  The apostles\\n| concluded that we need not become Jews in order to become Christians,\\n| and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us.\\n\\n1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom\\n4:15 notes that \"where no law is, there is no transgression.\"  Not only\\ndid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it\\nwas revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).\\n\\n2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise\\nwhich undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the\\npeople, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised\\n\"what ever He says to do we will do.\"  That is why the new covenant is\\nbased on \"better promises\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law\\nGod promised to \"put my laws in their minds and write them on their\\nhearts\" (Heb. 8:10).\\n\\n3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The\\nSabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt\\nhad been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been\\neven more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly\\nSabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at\\nany time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was\\n*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).\\n\\n4.  Israel stands for God\\'s people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*\\nthe Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the\\ncovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises\\nbelong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born\\ninto Israel is not enough \"For they are not all Israel, which are of\\nIsrael\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \"if ye be Christ\\'s, then are ye\\nAbraham\\'s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"  All Christians are\\nAbraham\\'s seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the\\ncriterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the\\npromise God made to all his people the Israelites.\\n\\n| \\n| While Christians agree that the OT Laws do not all apply to us,\\n| because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the Jews,\\n| we also expect to see some similarity between the things God expected\\n| from the Jews and the things he expects from us.  After all, it\\'s the\\n| same God.  However there are several ways of dealing with this.\\n| \\n| These days the most common approach is to separate the OT commandments\\n| into \"moral\" and \"ceremonial\".  Ceremonial commandments apply only to\\n| the Jews.  They are part of the specific Mosaic covenant.  These are\\n| thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision.  Moral laws apply to\\n| everyone.  Most of the 10 commands are part of the moral law, except\\n| for the commandment about the Sabbath.  I believe most people who take\\n| this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on\\n| the Sabbath is part of the ceremonial law, but a general obligation to\\n| worship regularly is part of the general moral law.  Thus Christians\\n| are free to choose the specific time we worship.\\n\\nPeople would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath\\ncommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the\\nceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even\\nif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan\\nsun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,\\nsanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders\\nagree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in\\nsoc.religion.christian.bible-study).\\n| \\n| A more radical approach (which is generally connected with John Calvin\\n| and the Reformed tradition) says that the Law as a whole is no longer\\n| binding.  Instead, we are entirely under grace, and our behavior\\n| should be guided solely by love.  Portions of the OT Law are still\\n| useful as guidance.  But they are not properly speaking legally\\n| binding on us.  In practice most people who take this position do not\\n| believe it is safe to leave Christians without moral guidannce.  While\\n| we may no longer be under Law, as sinners, it\\'s not safe for us to go\\n| into situations with no principles to guide us.  We\\'re too good at\\n| self-justification for that to be safe.  Thus Christians do have moral\\n| guidance, from things like Jesus\\' teachings, Paul\\'s advice, etc.\\n| These may not be precisely a Law, but they serve much the same\\n| function as, and have largely the same content as, the \"moral law\" in\\n| the previous analysis.  While Calvin would deny that we have a fixed\\n| legal responsibility to worship on any specific day, he would say that\\n| given human weakness, the discipline of regular worship is important.\\n| \\nI do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God\\nsays.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,\\nwhy is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the\\nSabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important\\nenough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that\\nthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but\\nfreed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in\\ncourt I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me\\ngrace, do I walk out of the court saying \"I can now go on speeding, for I\\nam now under grace?\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed\\nlimit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \"Di we then make void the law through\\nfaith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\"  \"Wherefore the law is\\nholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Rom. 7:12).\\n\\n| In both analyses, the specific day is not an issue.  As a matter of\\n| tradition, we worship on Sunday as a memorial of Christ\\'s\\n| resurrection.  There\\'s some debate about what Acts shows about early\\n| Christian worship.  The most common analysis is that is shows Jewish\\n| Christians continuing to go to Jewish services on the Sabbath, but\\n| that specifically Christian service were not necessarily held then.\\n| Act 20:7 shows worship on the first day (Sunday), and I Cor 16:2 also\\n| implies gatherings on that day.\\n| \\n| There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to\\n| worship on the Sabbath (Saturday).  The best-known are the Seventh-Day\\n| Adventists and Jehovah\\'s Witnesses.  They argue that Act 20:7 is not a\\n| regular worship service, but a special meeting to see Paul off, and\\n| that I Cor 16:2 doesn\\'t explicitly say it\\'s a regular worship service.\\n\\nDo you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows\\nthat the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did\\nnot go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to\\nAssos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \"lay by him in store\"\\nwith \"go to a worship service.\"\\n| \\n| It\\'s clear that this issue was a contested one in Paul\\'s time.  See\\n| Rom 14:5.  Paul\\'s advice is that we should be very careful about\\n| judging each other on issues like this.  One person sees a specific\\n| day as mandated by God, while another does not.  He who observes that\\n| specific day does it in honor of the Lord.  He who believes his\\n| worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the\\n| Lord.  (Those who believe that the Sabbath is still mandated argue\\n| that Paul is not referring to Sabbath worship here.  Note however Col\\n| 2:16, which says something similar but briefer.  It explicitly\\n| mentions Sabbath.)\\n\\nWrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath\\nday of the moral law.\\n| \\n| There are some differences among Christians about use of the word\\n| \"Sabbath\".  Originally the term referred to the 7th Day, the Jewish\\n| day of worship.  Many Christians now use it to refer to Sunday, the\\n| day of Christian worship.  They do this largely so that they can apply\\n| the 4th (or whatever -- there are a couple of different numbering\\n| schemes) commandment to it.  Reformed tradition does not do this.  It\\n| distinguishes between the Sabbath -- which is the observance mandated\\n| for Jews, and the Lord\\'s Day -- which is the free Christian worship.\\n| (The only reference I can find to this in the NT is Rev 1:10.)  There\\n| are also differences about laws regarding this day.  Many Christians\\n| support \"blue laws\", both in secular law and church law, setting aside\\n| that day and causing people to spend it in worship.  The more radical\\n| anti-legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the Jewish\\n| Sabbath, which is not appropriate to the free Christian worship of the\\n| Lord\\'s Day.\\n| \\nWhy would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments\\nwhich conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a\\nGod who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could\\nnot be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a\\nbroken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law\\nbreaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to\\nfollow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to\\nmake false gods, to violate God\\'s name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to\\nkill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight\\nwhen placed next to the word of God.\\n\\nDarius\\n\\n[It\\'s not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I\\nthink Paul\\'s comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is\\nprobably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing\\nwhat he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally\\naccept that those who \"esteem all days alike\" are similarly doing\\ntheir best to honor the Lord.\\n\\nHowever I\\'d like to be clear that I do not think there\\'s unambiguous\\nproof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I\\nindicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.\\n\\nThe difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually\\nabout something else.  They both look like they are talking about\\nnnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \"and they\\ngathered every Sunday for worship\".  We get various pieces of\\ninformation, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  \\n\\nAct 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple\\nworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the\\ntemple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of\\nChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn\\'t tell us\\nwhat day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius\\'\\nconfusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no\\nreason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the\\nBiblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to\\nme that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn\\'t say they gathered to\\nsee Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,\\nPaul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that\\'s just not explicit\\nenough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says\\nthat on the first day they should set aside money for Paul\\'s\\ncollection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially\\nto do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can\\'t disprove it,\\nbut the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be\\nwhen they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do\\nit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.\\nSo I think the most obvious reading of this is that \"on the first day\\nof every week\" simply means every time they gather for worship.  \\n\\nI think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements\\nis that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian\\nworship was.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the\\neyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts\\nnow rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing\\npeople for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and\\nAnnias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His\\nplan might be accomplished.\\n    But don\\'t forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to\\nexecute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to\\nfulfill the chorus of \"Let his blood be upon our hands\" of the crowd in\\nJersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel,\\nwhich was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish\\nother nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament. \\nDon\\'t you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, \"Mene, mene,\\ntekel, peres?\"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God\\'s\\njustice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians\\nas their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the\\nextirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel. \\nThe Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and\\nthe Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go\\non with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is\\nquite clear.\\nTwo things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to\\nquestion why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom,\\nHe made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans\\n9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of\\nJesus Christ is as follows: \"Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at\\nhand.\"  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - \"Let\\nthe dead bury the dead, come, follow me.\"  There is not an infinite\\namount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to\\nfollow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, \"well, alright,\\nyou can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your\\nplans.\"  He said \"Follow me.\"  His message is NOT \"I\\'m just a sweety-pie\\nwho would never hurt a fly, you\\'ve got all the time in the world, and\\nDivine Judgement, that\\'s only a fairy tale.\"  \"Our great God and Savior\"\\nJesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the\\nworld.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be\\nquestioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.\\n\\nD.

Instead of rationalizing our own fears and\\n>phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other\\n>socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through\\n>their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus...\\n\\nThe first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is \"obvious\"ly wrong to\\nbe angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angry\\nwhich is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at us\\nfor putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was \"forgive\\nthem Father, they know not what they do.\"  Knowing how forgiving Jesus\\nhas been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of\\nlove for Him.  Please don\\'t give in to anger, it will only cause\\nfoolish quarrels and more bad feelings.\\n\\nIt\\'s okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need to\\naddress it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone out\\nthere was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with\\nAIDS because they deserve punishment that others don\\'t then I would\\nframe a response something like this:\\n\\n\"It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which is\\nsimply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God\\'s punishment\\nfor people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of his\\nchildren equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  We\\nwill all be judged after we die, but until then we all have the\\nopportunity to accept God\\'s grace by earnestly seeking after him with\\nall of our hearts, believing the gospel\\'s testimony, repenting of our\\nsin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new life\\nfor him.\\n Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God\\'s arm is not\\nto short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart\\nor a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even through\\nthe worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all men\\nthat they may perhaps reach out and find him.\"\\n\\nThe second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears\\nof people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing is\\nactually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in the\\nearlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven\\'t been\\nexpressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount your\\nperceptions, but please try to be open-minded.\\n\\nYou are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people\\nbecause they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters and\\nI do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of the\\ncity and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with some\\nbrothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so\\nthat you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.\\n\\nThe third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual\\ncontracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their\\nsalvation in that there may be repetence involved.\\n\\nThe important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God\\'s\\ncommands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm or\\nmisfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way to\\nprevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways,\\nis to listen to God\\'s advice and have sex only with your wife or\\nhusband.\\n\\nI hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.\\n\\nLove,\\n\\nAaron Cardenas\\n',\n",

Firstly, what do you exactly mean by \"fundamentalist\"?  I will\\nfor the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes\\nthat the bible is God\\'s word to mankind?  I suspect that what happened\\nto him is what he\\'ll call being \"born again\"?  Anyway, was that recent?\\nIf the answer is \"yes\" to all the questions above, it is quite\\nunderstandable.  However, IMO, I\\'ld rather give advice to your friend!\\nI think I\\'ve been through something similar to him, and one thing I can\\nsay is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to\\ncommunicate from different worldviews.  Why he talks about those things\\nis because they are now \"obvious\" to him.  What is \"obvious\" to him is\\nnot obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because\\nfrom his point of view, he has been on \"both sides of the fence\".  This\\nI mean that before he turned \"fundamentalist\", you two are agreeable\\nbecause both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as if\\na new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the\\ndiscovery of let\\'s say a new continent, or a new planet.  To him, he\\'s\\ngot to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than\\nwhere he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now.\\nYou have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to\\nyou, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth that\\nrisk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand\\nand listen to you as well.  At this moment, it may be difficult because\\nhe is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about,\\nhowever, he may not realise that he\\'s really putting you off.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\n>the Bible that it is so.\\'  So my question is, how can I convince him\\n>that this is a subject better left undiscussed, so we can preserve\\n>what is (in all areas other than religious beliefs) a great\\n>friendship?  How do I convince him that I am \\'beyond saving\\' so he\\n>won\\'t try?  Thanks for any advice.\\n\\nSo far, I\\'ve only been trying to explain things from his side.  However,\\nI do understand how you feel too, because I wasn\\'t a Christian for a good\\npart of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or\\n\"fundamentalists\" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their\\nfaith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately,\\n\"religious belief\" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism\\nis also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is\\ninevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise),\\nit will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take both\\nsides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you can\\ndo your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he\\'s\\ntrying to convince you about, that it\\'s beyond you or not your concern\\n\"for now\".  Don\\'t tell him it\\'s nonsense, because to him it is reality -\\nand that would be a real insult.  He\\'ll also have to be careful not to\\ninsult where you stand too.\\n\\nLike I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too.\\nI\\'ll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a\\nChristian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little\\ndifferently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited\\nand just blabbered away about what I\\'ve found!  To me, it was too good\\nnot to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didn\\'t really care most of\\nthe time what they thought.  You will probably think he\\'s crazy too -\\nbut God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in\\nmind.  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real\\nto him, he doesn\\'t see why God can\\'t be real to you too.\\n\\nI don\\'t know how helpful this is to you.  But all the best anyhow -\\nthis is quite a challenge for you to face.

What people don\\'t understand about the inserts is that they\\nreport every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating\\nthat the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough\\nliability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to\\nhappen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information\\non a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the\\nAMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific.\\nThere are very few drugs that someone hasn\\'t reported a death from taking.\\nPatients don\\'t realize that and don\\'t usually appreciate the risks\\nto themselves properly.  I\\'m sure Herman is going to \"go ballistic\",\\nbut so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been\\nreported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume\\nit could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will\\nrefuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for\\nPDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with\\ntools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need.\\nI am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the\\ndomain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions\\nabout migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient.\\nFor common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help\\nquite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the\\ncomputer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly,\\nphysicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have,\\nas is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked\\nthings that the patients should have found out from their physician\\nbut didn\\'t.  Why they didn\\'t isn\\'t always the physician\\'s fault either.\\nSometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They won\\'t be as afraid to\\nask the system, we hope.\\n-- \\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nGordon Banks  N3JXP      | \"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\\ngeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\" \\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

The article\\nincluded photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in\\npreparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the\\nspecifications given in the Bible. \\n\\nWhat was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are\\ncomplete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli\\ngovernment before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the\\nvery recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is\\nunoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that\\nthe original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding\\nimpossible without sparking a holy war. \\n\\nNow it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming\\nsacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days.\\nAlthough the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think\\nit is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it\\nhappen.

Overacker writes, responding to Simon:\\n\\n   I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the\\n   net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in\\n   schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that\\'s really beside\\n   the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?\\n   Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as\\n   provided for in canon law.\\n\\nHere\\'s some of the theology involved for the interested.\\n\\nThere is confusion over this issue of the SSPX\\'s \"schism\"; often the\\nbasic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:\\n\\n- true obedience\\n- false obedience\\n- disobedience\\n- schism\\n\\nTake the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2\\nimportant elements involved here for my purposes:\\n\\n1) a command\\n2) the response made to the command\\n\\nAs far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the\\nPope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be\\nILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god\\nDagon when every other full moon comes around.\\n\\nAs far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do\\nwhat is commanded, or to COMPLY.\\n\\nMaking a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:\\n\\ncommand         response            name\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\nLEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience\\nILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience\\nLEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience\\nILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience\\n\\nSo now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.\\n\\nObedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of\\nthe commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to\\nconsider someone\\'s compliance or refusal and then say whether they are\\n\"obedient\" or \"disobedient\".  You also have to take into consideration\\nwhether the commands are good or bad.\\n\\nIn my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god\\nDagon, and they all refuse, they aren\\'t being disobedient at all!\\n\\nAs far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly\\nrefusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that\\nalone is insufficient to allow one to label them \"disobedient\".  You\\nalso have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.\\n\\nAnd there\\'s the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been\\ncommanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of\\ncourse disagreed.\\n\\nSo where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak\\nPopes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only\\nway to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the\\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.\\n\\nThe problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of\\nwhat is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of\\nAmerican Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You\\nwill never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press\\nin this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I\\nget -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the\\nSociety of Saint Pius X.)\\n\\nMany Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some\\nsoundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually\\nsome Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand,\\nthere is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the\\nPopes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to\\nhelp the situation by obeying them where they\\'re wrong.  In fact, if\\nthe situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very\\nleast, they\\'re wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing\\nto love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this\\nbadly.\\n\\nSchism... let\\'s move on to schism.  What is it?\\n\\nSchism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate\\ncommand).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it\\'s a superset, so\\nit doesn\\'t work the other way around: not all disobeyers are\\nschismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don\\'t comply with\\nthe Holy Father\\'s desires doesn\\'t make them schismatics.\\n\\nSo what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a\\nschism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.\\n\\nYou must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any\\ndecent reference on Catholic theology, and that\\'s what you\\'ll find:\\nthe distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to\\ncommand.\\n\\nHere\\'s what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:\\n\\n    ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this\\n    character it must include besides the trangression of the commands\\n    of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.\\n    (from the CE article \"Schism\")\\n\\nIs the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear\\nno: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every\\nday.  And that\\'s all that matters as far as schism goes.\\n\\nWhat all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the\\nconsideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position\\nis a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and\\nschism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they\\nthink that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of\\nthe Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone\\nwho finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)\\n\\nNow, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the\\nHoly Father\\'s motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", you can find out.  It\\'s the\\ndefinitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically\\nPapal act.  It\\'s not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter\\nthat the Pope has possibly never even read.  It\\'s from the Pope\\nhimself.  His boss is God... there\\'s no one else to complain to.\\n\\nIn this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:\\n\\n1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre\\nconstituted a schismatic act.\\n\\n2) Archbishop Lefebvre\\'s problem was a misunderstanding of the nature\\nof Tradtion.\\n\\nBoth are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope\\'s points.\\n\\nAs far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting\\narticle in a translation of the Italian magazine \"Si Si No No\".  It\\nall gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal\\nconsecrations imply rejection of the Pope\\'s jurisdiction, then they\\nwould truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication\\nunder the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is\\nthis: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal\\nconsecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power\\nof Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be\\nconferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the\\nPope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite\\nwell, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over\\nanyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.\\n\\nThe \"Si Si No No\" article was interesting in that it posited that the\\nreason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel,\\npost-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea,\\nepiscopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article\\nto a friend, unfortunately, so can\\'t tell you more.  I believe they\\nquoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.\\n\\nThe Pope\\'s thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me.\\nThere\\'s no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic\\ntheology.  So why does the Pope think this?\\n\\nAs far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here\\'s\\nthe passage in question:\\n\\n    The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete\\n    and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does\\n    not take sufficiently into the account the living character of\\n    Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,\\n\\n        comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the\\n        help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into\\n        the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes\\n        about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and\\n        study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.\\n        It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which\\n        they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who\\n        have received, along with their right of succession in the\\n        espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.\\n\\n    But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which\\n    opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the\\n    Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to\\n    remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond\\n    with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ\\n    himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.\\n\\n    (Papal motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", 2 July 1988)\\n\\nIt seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can\\nbe simplified to the following:\\n\\n- Vatican Council II has happened.\\n- I am the Pope.\\n\\nThe argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that\\nArchbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them.\\nThis is weak, to say the least!\\n\\nIt would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed\\nArchbishop Lefebvre\\'s concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II\\'s\\nstand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius\\nIX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to\\nignore what all these Popes said on the subject?\\n\\nI don\\'t know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the\\nSSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey\\n\"justified disobedience\" or even \"obeying God rather than man\".\\nCalling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in\\nWonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.\\n\\nSimilarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope\\nsays that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it\\nexists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break,\\nthat there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will\\nshortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?\\n\\nIt seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing\\nyou are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it\\ndo you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in\\nthe process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church\\ndiscipline?  It\\'s one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his\\npowers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It\\'s something else to\\nsay that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is\\nall in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are\\nnot legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally\\nit has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope.\\nWhile they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they\\nhave admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door\\nto people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly\\nobeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated.\\nThis would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command\\nthat you say defines schism.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

An atheist is one for whom all things can\\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\\ndetermnined.\\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\nacquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\nan event can have value. \\nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\\nhill.\\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\nestablish your values.\\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n- that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\nThat you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\nor God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\nI didn\\'t make these rules, it\\'s inherent in naturalistic atheism and\\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\netc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\\nweight whatsoever.\\n\\nBill\\n',\n",

       " u'From: halsall@murray.fordham.edu (Paul Halsall)\\nSubject: Catholic Liturgy\\nReply-To: halsall@murray.fordham.edu\\nOrganization: J. Random Misconfigured Site\\nLines: 60\\n\\n\\n\\tThe problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue for\\nsome time.  The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a\\nsymbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that\\nthe _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar,\\nRelics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real,\\nalmost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real\\nsacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all\\nto be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking\\nprecludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it\\nsimply IS holy.\\n\\nBut, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if\\nwell- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely\\nto see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which\\ncould be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the\\nmass has become a commercial for God\\'s grace rather than the real\\nthing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn\\'t\\ndare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have\\nbeen encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing\\non _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in\\nliturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or\\nthe heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic\\nexample of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of\\nthe sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita\\nbread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered\\nin particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but\\nCatholics in the past would have been distraught at this real\\ndesacration of the real symbol of Jesus\\' body.\\n\\nModern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We\\ntry to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac\\npriest get up and \\'explain\\' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and\\nstart pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience.\\nIt doesn\\'t help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and\\nthree chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated\\ntunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the\\ngenius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize\\' is only\\nslightly better.\\n\\nWhat are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it\\ndoesn\\'t work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well\\nprepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW\\na matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is\\nthe attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative\\nliturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean\\nthe Church will be socially conservative.\\n\\nIn NYC I can recommend:\\n\\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St.\\n\\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy, \\n\\tSt. Joseph\\'s, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, \"clean\", largely gay\\n\\tOratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful\\n\\nAvoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.\\n\\nHappy Easter: Christos Aneste\\', Christos Voskrezhne, Christ is Risen\\n\\nPaul Halsall\\nHalsall@murray.fordham.edu\\n',\n",

In comparison, in \\nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \\ndecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \\ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \\nthis disease from 1985 through 1992. \\n     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \\nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, \\nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \\n(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \\n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \\nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \\nof all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by \\nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \\nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \\nreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \\nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \\ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000). \\n     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \\nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \\nstate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \\noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \\nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency \\nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. \\n     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \\nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \\nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \\nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases \\ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, \\nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \\n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \\nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \\nrespectively). \\n     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \\nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \\nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea \\nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \\n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \\nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). \\n     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \\nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \\nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, \\nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \\nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \\n(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \\n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \\nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. \\n\\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE \\nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health.

Surveillance and Information Systems Br, \\nDiv of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for \\nPrevention Svcs, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 \\nmay represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more \\ncomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH \\nsurveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \\ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \\nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. \\nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \\nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \\ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. \\n     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \\nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \\nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \\n(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \\ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \\nfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \\npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \\n-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \\ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \\nand gang affiliation. \\n     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \\nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \\n19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \\ngonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \\ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-\\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \\nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. \\n     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \\ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting \\npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \\nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \\nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \\nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \\nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \\nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational \\ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \\nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \\nand health-care providers. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Child safety seats and safety \\nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \\nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \\nbelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \\nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \\ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \\noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \\nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In \\naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \\nuse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between \\nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \\nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \\nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \\n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this \\nstudy. \\n     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \\n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \\nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \\nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 \\n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent \\nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \\nthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \\nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \\nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). \\nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software \\nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \\nand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined \\nby p values of less than 0.05. \\n     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six \\n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \\nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \\nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \\nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \\nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \\nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \\nsafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \\nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. \\nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \\nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \\n(no-law states). \\n     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \\nconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and \\nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \\ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \\n43.2%, respectively). \\n     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \\nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \\nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported \\nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \\n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for \\nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \\nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of \\nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \\nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \\ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). \\n     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \\nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, \\nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \\nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \\nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8). \\n\\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \\nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \\nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \\nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these \\nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \\nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \\nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10). \\n     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \\nchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \\nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low \\neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \\nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \\nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \\ndirected at parents with young children. \\n     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In \\naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nthey become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, \\nthose who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do \\nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \\nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \\nsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \\nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \\nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \\nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

The \\nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \\nAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \\nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. \\n     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \\nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \\nkidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general \\ndiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand \\nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \\nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \\ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose. \\n     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \\ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, \\nthe reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be \\nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \\npool, or random variation. \\n     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \\ncollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in \\nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \\nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Throughout the season increases in the indices \\nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \\nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of \\nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \\nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \\n1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \\nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \\nA(H1N1). \\n     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \\ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \\nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \\namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. \\n     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \\nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \\ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual \\nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \\nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. \\nAuthors: Louisa E.

Together, \\nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \\ntechnology (ART) procedures. \\n\\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or \\npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \\nmanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \\nproceed with one of the ART procedures. \\n\\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \\nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \\nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \\nART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \\nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \\ntraditional therapies. \\n\\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \\nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \\nrealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: \\n\\no in vitro \\no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \\n  transfer \\no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. \\nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \\ntowards improved success of these technologies. \\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n                           Future Areas of Research\\n\\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \\nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \\ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \\ndisease. \\n\\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \\nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \\namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \\n\\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \\nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \\nhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \\nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \\nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \\nsex-linked disorders. \\n\\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \\nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \\nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \\nof affected children. \\n\\n\\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\\nCollege of Medicine \\nUniversity of Arizona\\nTucson, Arizona\\n\\n               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for the\\n                           Management of Infertility\\n\\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \\nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. \\n\\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \\nAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of \\nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \\nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \\nto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \\nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being \\nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \\nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nassisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \\nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \\nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \\nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \\nlupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \\nobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic \\negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \\nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \\nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  \\n     Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \\ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male \\nfactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \\nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \\ncycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \\nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. \\n     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \\ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \\nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well \\nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \\novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \\nattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \\nof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \\nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \\ntraditional therapies. \\n     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \\nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \\navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \\nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \\nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \\nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \\nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \\nbe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \\nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \\nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \\nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \\nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \\nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. \\n\\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \\nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \\nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \\ntube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \\noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \\nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \\ntransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \\npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \\nand/or idiopathic infertility.    \\n     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \\nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \\nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \\npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might \\nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \\nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \\nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \\npatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \\na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \\ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \\nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \\nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos. \\n     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \\nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \\nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \\ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. \\n     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \\nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \\nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \\nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \\nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \\nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \\nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \\nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. \\n     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \\nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \\nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in \\ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 \\npercent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the \\nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \\nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \\nthrough enzymatic digestion. \\n     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \\npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \\nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \\nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \\nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such \\nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \\noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \\nestablish conception. \\n\\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\\nCollege of Medicine \\n--------- end of part 2 ------------\\n\\n---\\n      Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165\\n      Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15\\n                Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na\\n\",\n",

Does anone have any information\\n\\nI\\'m not sure that this condition is \"recognised\" anywhere (in the\\nsense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries\\nbetween it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic\\nfeatures, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.\\n\\nPost-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease\\nby clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities\\nare mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of\\nongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of\\ndeclining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks.\\nMusculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless\\ncontributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows\\nmuscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old\\ndenervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit\\naction potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation\\n(fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation\\nwith reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active\\ndenervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme\\nstaining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.\\n\\nPost-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically\\nevident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio,\\nthe patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one\\nyear to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio\\nbefore who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among\\npolio survivors than among people who never had polio.\\n\\nThe cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little\\nevidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or\\ndestructive immunologic response to virus antigen.\\n\\nThere is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have\\nanything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells,\\nmotor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than\\npatients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration.\\nBoth groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason\\nfor these \"acute\" changes in a \"chronic\" disease (old polio) is\\nunknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge\\nnumbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several\\nyears.\\n\\nThere are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio\\nsyndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny\\ndeterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe\\npolio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain.\\nThey also tend to score higher on depression scales of\\nneuropsychologic tests.\\n\\nMy take on this (I\\'m sure some will disagree):  after recovery from\\nsevere polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons,\\nligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or\\ndegenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing\\npain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads\\nto progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am\\nperhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS\\npatient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe\\nthat PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than\\nnon-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but\\nwithout PPS complaints).\\n---\\n .

I was just reading John 14 this morning (I think that is the\\nright chapter, anyway it is close and I don\\'t have a Bible at work to\\ncheck with.) and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about his\\nimpending death and he says that he will be going away and then later\\nhe will be with them.  He said something along the lines of \"I will\\nbe in you and you will be in me.\"  (Again I cannot provide the exact\\nquote or citation.)  Anyway, my understanding of this is that\\nthe Second Coming will not be an outward event.  It is an inward\\nevent, Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him.\\nIf you look for a person you will be deceived.\\n\\nIt seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that would\\nbe a political or military leader and so didn\\'t recognize Jesus when\\nhe came.  Jesus tried to show that his Kingdom was not of this earth.\\nA lot of what I have seen written about the Second Coming seems to\\nbased on an expectation of Christ coming back and finally taking over\\nthe world and running it the way it should be.  It sounds a lot like\\nwhat the Jews were looking for.  The First Coming wasn\\'t like that and\\nI see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that either.\\n\\nOh and by the way, I don\\'t expect it to happen once.

Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal\\nimmune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant \\ninvolved with acupuncture needle insertion. \\n\\nMost acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They      \\ndo this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of \\ndiseases via this route...so it\\'s good business to advertise \"disposable needlesused here.\" These needles tend to be of a lower quality however, \\nbeing poorly manufactured and too \"sharp\" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                        \\nIf I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get \\ntheir own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.      \\nThe risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly \\nuse an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong              \\npatient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates \\nthis risk. Better quality needles tend to \"slide\" past vessels and            \\nnerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                        \\nAcupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all \\nsolid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into \\nmeridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require \\nthe same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be \\ninjected into the body as it would  be in a typical \"shot.\" when the skin is \\npuntured. On the other hand when the solid \\nacupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to \"squeeze\" the needle \\nfrom the tip to the level of insertion such that any \\'cooties\\' that \\nhaven\\'t been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain \\non the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. \\n\\nOf course in TCM...the body\\'s exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory \\nand immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture \\nsite.\\n\\n\\nWhile I\\'m fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease \\ntransmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for \\nwhat complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful. \\n\\nJohn Badanes, DC, CA\\nromdas@uclink.berkeley.edu\\n                                                                                                    \\n  \\n',\n",

Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible, Steve, and I \\n>see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  \\n\\nThey are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).\\nOops, that is not a recognized \"illness\" in the psychological community,\\nbetter not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)\\n\\nActually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians\\nwill type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,\\njust e-mail me and I\\'ll send a summary file to you).  In the general\\npopulation, NT\\'s comprise only about 12% of the population, but among\\nphysicians it is much much higher (I don\\'t know the exact percentage -\\nany help here a.p.p.er\\'s?)\\n\\nOne driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious\\ncholeric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to\\ncontrol, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are\\nalso extroverted, they are best described as \"Field Marshalls\".  This trait\\nis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to\\nlead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,\\nto raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and\\ntechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-\\nminded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types\\nand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,\\nwhen the NT person has self-image challenges, the \"dark-side\" of this\\npersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.\\n\\nA physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their\\ntemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),\\nand is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient\\nmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I\\'ve\\nknown many M.D.\\'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don\\'t oblige them\\nwith a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they\\nusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an\\nextreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).\\n\\nMaybe we need more NF doctor\\'s.  :^)\\n\\nEnough on this subject - let\\'s move on to candida bloom.\\n\\n\\n>Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \\n>no idea how the human body interacts with it\\'s environment and how that \\n>balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics...  Could it just be\\n>professional jealousy?  I couldn\\'t help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did.\\n\\nYou\\'ve helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have\\nbeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from \\'anal retentivitis\\', but being\\nthe phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people\\nmyself in past posts.  Let\\'s all try to raise the level of this discussion\\nabove the level of anal effluent.\\n\\n\\n>...Humans have all \\n>kinds of different organisms living in the GI system (mouth, stomach, small \\n>and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \\n>nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \\n>system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \\n>the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \\n>toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \\n>these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \\n>residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \\n>happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\\n\\nIn my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune\\nstressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses\\nwere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.\\nI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks\\nof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial\\ninfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won\\'t get into the\\ndetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT\\'s made this\\ndiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the\\ndifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed\\na bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you\\nunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal\\ntherapy below).\\n\\n\\nThe first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor\\nmucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being\\nconsidered \\'systemic\\' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween\\ninfection.\\n\\n\\n>Steve got real upset with Elaine\\'s doctor because he was using anti-fungals \\n>and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \\n>vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \\n>Elaine\\'s doctor a quack.\\n\\nI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after\\nmy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then\\ndropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received\\nzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly\\ncomplex ways as my doctor explained (he\\'s one of those \\'evil\\' orthomolecular\\nspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,\\nhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)\\nsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.\\nCall me carrot face.  :^)\\n\\nHopefully, Elaine\\'s doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to\\nall supplements.  I\\'m even reevaluating some supplements I\\'m taking, for\\nexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had\\ngood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order\\nimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is\\nnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.\\n\\n\\n>survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \\n>the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \\n\\nThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that\\nI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my\\nsinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that\\ndemonstrate candida \"blooms\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation\\n(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one\\nweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this\\ntime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on\\nSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered\\nnormal).\\n\\nBTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can\\'t\\nremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950\\'s\\nwhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)\\naspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus\\ninflammation symptoms.  I\\'ll have to dig out that reference again since it\\nis relevant to this discussion.\\n\\n\\n>some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \\n>membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \\n>the candida or not isn\\'t certain.\\n\\nMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic\\nresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.\\nAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test\\nis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow\\npart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a \\nthreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to\\nCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane\\nirritation due to the body\\'s allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,\\none does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a \\nPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.\\n\\nBTW, and I\\'ll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \"Sinus Survival\",\\nhas routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic\\nanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic\\nsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in\\nthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over\\n90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it\\ndoesn\\'t cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection\\nis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He\\'s also found that\\nnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.\\n\\nThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is\\naggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway\\ninto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by\\ndirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,\\nlots of \\'ifs\\', and \\'implies\\', which doesn\\'t please the hard-core NT who\\nhas to have the double-blind study or it\\'s a non-issue, but one has to start\\nwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.\\n\\n\\n>If it\\'s internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \\n>nondescript.  \\n\\nThis brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny\\nand reject any and all aspects of the \\'yeast hypothesis\\' until the\\nappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can\\'t observe or culture\\nthe yeast \"bloom\" in the gut or sinus, then there\\'s no way to diagnose or\\neven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually\\nimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot\\nbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.\\n\\nIt\\'s a real Catch-22.\\n\\nAnother Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the \\'yeast hypothesis\\' say that\\nno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it\\'s not\\nup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which\\nshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should\\nbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to\\nconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,\\nyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to\\ncompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study\\nneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get\\nfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I\\'m very aware of this for the\\nsmaller funded projects).  I\\'m afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other\\ndoctors got together, pooled their practice\\'s case histories and anecdotes\\ninto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get\\nnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.\\n\\nIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have\\n*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to\\nnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable\\nhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence\\nto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would\\nalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it\\'s a done issue - \\nexcessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will\\nnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold\\nsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...\\n\\n\\n>Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \\n>the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \\n>vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \\n>ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \\n>they broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \\n>response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \\n>from their diets.  About 30% of all American\\'s die with less Vitamin A than \\n>they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \\n>A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \\n>barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \\n>inflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \\n\\nAren\\'t there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the\\nsinus mucus membranes and cilia?\\n\\n\\n>While diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \\n>this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \\n>knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \\n>competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \\n>available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \\n>use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \\n>the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \\n>inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \\n>antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \\n>just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \\n>vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\\n\\nAgain, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus\\nspecies can grow hyphae (\"roots\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing\\nin bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but\\nyou can\\'t kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic\\nanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such\\nas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has\\nbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I\\'ve been in\\ne-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-\\nterm treatment of GI tract \"candidiasis\".  It\\'s like trying to weed a garden\\nby cutting off what\\'s above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come\\nout again once you walk away.\\n\\nThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida \"bloom\" can partially\\ngrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms\\nin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \"systemic\" in the\\nclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive\\nbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that\\nis potentially lethal.\\n\\n\\n>In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \\n>reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \\n>favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \\n>humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \\n>minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \\n\\nAlso, if one is an \\'anal retentive\\', like I\\'ve been diagnosed in a prior\\npost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)\\n\\n\\n>If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \\n>blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \\n>bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \\n>occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \\n>for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \\n>place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \\n>but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \\n>has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \\n>specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \\n>false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \\n>basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it\\'s nice to know that I don\\'t have \\n>colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \\n>doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\\n\\nAs I\\'ve said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system\\nthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt\\nalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don\\'t work.\\nFor example, I went to three ENT\\'s, who all said that I will just have to live\\nwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab\\'s failed (they did mention\\nsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren\\'t plugged and it would not\\nget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and\\nfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and\\nequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly\\nimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.\\nOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have\\nimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the\\nexperience of the three ENT\\'s I saw who said that I\\'d just have to \"live with\\nit\".  I\\'m confident I will reach what one could call a total \"cure\".  The\\nanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction\\nbecause of my overuse of ab\\'s for the last four years.  (Note:  for those\\nhaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.\\nBe sure to get the revised edition.)\\n\\n\\n>...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \\n>GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \\n>patients is a non-existent syndrome.\\n\\nDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his\\nvisits to several ENT\\'s totally floored him when they said \"you\\'ll just have\\nto live with it\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and\\nnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now\\nshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road\\nto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a\\nsystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of\\nanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own\\npractice.  I\\'m sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-\\n\"yeast hypothesis\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\\n\"it\\'s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\", to put it mildly.\\nI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating\\ntheir moral obligations to help the patient.\\n\\nMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are\\nconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \"hypothetical\\nyeast overgrowth\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people\\nhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues\\nhave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -\\nyou cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does\\nsomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a\\nthousand of his patients, shouldn\\'t you at least sit up and take notice?\\nMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works\\ninstead of why it shouldn\\'t work.  I\\'m afraid a lot of doctors have become\\nso enamored with \"scientific correctness\" that they are ignoring the patients\\nthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which\\nwe don\\'t see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when\\nyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach\\n(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having\\nexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional\\nmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I\\nwent to a couple of doctor\\'s who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,\\nand as a result I have found significant relief.\\n\\nWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up\\nsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having\\nhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)\\ntherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the\\naccepted therapies are ineffective?  I\\'d like to hear a doctor tell me:\\n\"well, I\\'ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this\\ncountry, and since they clearly don\\'t work for you, I now have the authority\\nto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I\\ncan\\'t promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign\\nsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of\\nthese unproven therapies, and I\\'ll have to register your case at the State\\nBoard.\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would\\'ve jumped on this\\npronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic\\nreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much\\nrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the\\npatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,\\nand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would\\nbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the\\ncompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it\\'s doing everything\\nit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism\\nthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of\\nwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all\\n(true quackery).\\n\\nI better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.\\n\\n\\n>If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32\\nalternative health therapies.]\\n\\n  ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the\\n  1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to \\'illuminate\\'\\n  their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object\\n  was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its\\n  surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner\\n  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found\\n  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead\\n  and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones\\n  were subject to changes.  The object\\'s life activity was also visible in\\n  highly variable colour patterns.\\n\\n  High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in\\n  the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up\\n  seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at\\n  Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and\\n  others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.\\n\\n  Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people\\'s\\n  fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on\\n  healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers\\n  but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and\\n  spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose\\n  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that\\n  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person\\n  isn\\'t actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to\\n  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.\\n\\n  But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is\\n  the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from\\n  which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the\\n  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely\\n  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can \\'see\\'\\n  the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing\\n  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern\\n  can\\'t possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would\\n  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid\\n  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than\\n  the actual object itself.\\n\\n  [...]\\n\\n  Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally \\'charged\\' by a healer\\n  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...\\n\\n\\nFrom the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, \"Reality shopping; a\\nconsumer\\'s guide to new age hokum.\", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986,\\nvNON4 p4(11).

Many paranormal\\n  movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for\\n  instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will\\n  emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and\\n  hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that\\n  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.

Faust, who reported their findings\\n  in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The\\n  variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on\\n  the surface of the body and not to mysterious \"auras\" or even\\n  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.

The Jews of Jesus\\'s time believed that all sickness was the\\nresult of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was\\nblind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.

This is the central\\nmessage of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins,\\nand was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of\\nour sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for\\nour sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He\\nhas graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or \\nsome other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting\\non the sacrifice that Jesus made.\\n\\nIn case you couldn\\'t tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when\\nI see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and\\nphobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other\\nsocially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through\\ntheir own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ,\\nno more and no less than we do.  I\\'ve said this before, but I think\\nit\\'s a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus\\nhealed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on\\nthis earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS.\\nShe has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed \\nrelationship with God.  Her theology isn\\'t what I would want it to be,\\nbut God\\'s grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining\\nweight (she\\'s had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is\\nexcellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.

A convert no less, attracted by the\\nrational tradition [Aquinas et al] and the emotional authenticity\\n[in comp. with the faddishness of Anglicanism] to Roman Catholicism. I\\nnever had much time for the pope - or any other heirarchs - but I did, and\\ndo, believe in the sacremental system. I always felt quite happy to\\nlook down my nose at those such as John Emery [a few posts back] who\\nhad to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith, entirely\\noblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same [with\\nmiracles too], and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the\\nBible as God\\'s sole revelation, it was not very good logic to argue\\nthat the Bible proved God. No, I was happy to accept the CHURCH as God\\'s\\nrevelation. It was the Church after all that existed before the Bible, the\\nChurch that choose [under grace of course] the canon of scripture. Protestant\\nludicrosity, I thought, was shown by Protestants breathtaking acceptance\\nof Luther\\'s right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked.\\n\\tBut recently I read Peter Brown\\'s _Body and Society_. It is very\\nwell researched, and well written. But is raises some very upsetting\\nquestions. The early Christians were weird - even more so than today\\'s\\ncarzy fundies. They had odd views on sex, odder views on the body, \\ntotally ludicrous views about demons, and distinctly uncharitable\\nviews about other human beings. \\n\\tnow the question is this: were the first Christians just as\\nweird, but we\\'ve got used to them, or did the pristine \"Fall of the\\nChurch\" happen within one generation. It certainly did\\'nt have to\\nwait until the Triumph of the Church under Constantine. If so,\\nwha does  this say about God\\'s promise to always support the Church.\\nIt\\'s no use throwing the usual Protestant pieties about the Church\\nnot being an organization at me. It\\'s a community or it is nothing,\\nand it was the early communities that were weird. The institional\\nchurch was a model of sanity by comparison.\\n\\tI would be interested in serious Catholic and Orthodox responses to\\nthis entirely serious issue. I\\'m not sure it is an issue for Protestants\\nwith their \"soul alone with Jesus\" approach, but for we who see the\\n\"ecclesia\" as a \"koinoia\" over time and space, the weird early\\nChristians are a problem.\\n\\n[This is an exaggeration of the Protestant view.  Many Protestants\\nhave a strong appreciation for the role of the Church.  \"The soul\\nalone with God\" is certainly important for Protestants, but it\\'s by no\\nmeans the whole story.\\n\\nI have read the sort of history you talk about.  As you point out,\\nProtestants don\\'t have quite the same problem you do, because we\\nbelieve that the church had a Fall at some point.  However Protestant\\nmythology typically places the Fall around the time of Constantine (or\\nmore likely, regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion,\\nstarting from Constantine but getting worse as the Pope accumulated\\npower during the medieval period.)  The consequences of having it\\nearlier are somewhat worrisome even to us.  Most Protestants accept\\nthe theological results of the early ecumenical councils, including\\nsuch items as the Trinity and Incarnation.  Indeed in the works of\\nReformers such as Luther and Calvin, you\\'ll find Church Fathers such\\nas Augustine quoted all the time.  I think you\\'ll find many\\nProtestants resistant to the idea that the Early Church as a whole was\\n\"wierd\".  (There is an additional problem for Protestants that I don\\'t\\nmuch want to talk about in this context, since it\\'s been looked at\\nrecently -- that\\'s the question of whether one can really think of\\nAugustine and other Fathers as being proto-Protestants.  Their views\\non Mary, the authority of the Pope, etc, are not entirely congenial to\\nProtestant thought.)\\n\\nOne thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology.\\nThere are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church.  What\\nconcerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see.  We\\nsee every Christian who courted martyrdom.  But I think there\\'s good\\nreason to believe that most ordinary Christians were more prudent than\\nthat.  We see the heroic virgins.  But I think there\\'s good reason to\\nthink that many Christians were happily married.

Christianity is not the cause of the massacres\\nand horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the fault\\nof people who misunderstand Jesus Christ\\'s message, and modify\\nit to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter their\\nambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in\\nthe New Testament.  With every truthful and good message that\\ncarries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitable\\nfact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distorted\\nway, with inevitable consequences.\\n\\nThe Bible\\'s message is that we are to love all people, and\\nthat all people are redeemable.  It preaches a message of\\nrepentance, and of giving.  Unfortunately, all people have\\ndeceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this message\\naround and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways.\\nThis is also a fundamental Christian doctrine.\\n\\nOne of the problems is that you look at the world through\\nthe eyes of Western history.  I think that you will find\\nmany, many cases of massacres that were instigated by\\npeople who never claimed they were Christian.  I am not saying\\nthis to justify the massacres that were, but I am merely\\npointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already.\\n\\nConsider the world without Christianity.  I doubt that we\\nwould have the same freedoms in the countries in which we\\nlive, if it wasn\\'t for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ.\\nPerhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion\\n(I won\\'t name any here, though one comes to mind) which\\nwould not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such\\nsubjects.\\n\\nPoint the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for\\npower, greed and hatred.  Please don\\'t point the blame at\\na message which preaches fundamental giving and denial, in\\nlove for others.\\n\\nYours in Christ,\\n\\nAndrew McVeigh\\n\\n\\np.s. I believe that a line of questioning like you presented\\nis, strangely enough, compatible with becoming a Christian.\\nCertainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviour\\nof the world, and especially Christians.

Since this aunt and uncle have 5 kids I felt they would be more\\nrelevant than I, who have none (yet).\\n\\n>1.  Ages & sexes of children\\n     13-year-old (13YO) twins, 10YO boy, 6.5YO boy, 2YO girl\\n\\n>2.  Do you spank your kids?\\n     I don\\'t call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.\\n\\n>3.  If so how often?\\n     I don\\'t call it spanking because it\\'s more of a reaction to something\\nvery dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running\\ninto the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has\\nnot been spanked yet.\\n     They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course\\nI give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they\\'re still loved.\\n\\n>4.  Do you use an implement to spank with?\\n     No, that would be too painful.  If it\\'s too traumatic they never recall\\nwhy they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time\\nto go get a toolmeans you\\'re not doing it right away, and that lessens the\\nimpact.  It\\'s very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the\\nfact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds -\\nis called a spanking.\\n>\\n>5. If you do not spank, what method of discipline do you use?\\n     Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared\\na good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made\\nsure they didn\\'t play together for 5 days so he\\'d know that would make him\\nlose friends very quickly.  He\\'s never done anything like that since.\\n     We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don\\'t keep\\narguing with me over leaving, since it\\'s hard to argue with a macine.\\nI will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won\\'t be over until they\\ncalm down if they\\'re too tantrumy.

It\\'s right outside of Akron, in the northeast part of Ohio.\\n\\n>8.  While under the age of 16 did you ever commit a criminal\\n>offence?\\n     No, and none of my kids would dream of it.  I hope you can use this to\\nteach all parents that physical punishment isn\\'t always required - parents use\\nthat as an excuse to hit too hard.\\n\\n>9.  How ere you disciplined as a kid\\n     Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband\\'s have never\\nused spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they\\nwere almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And,\\nnone of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God\\'s law.\\n     Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that \"what\\nye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.\"  The Bible also says in all\\nthings to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.)\\nThere is no room for selfish anger, which I\\'ll admit I\\'ve been tempted with\\nat times.  When I\\'ve felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved\\na little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the\\ndevil\\'s work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid\\nto his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God\\'s\\nforgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that\\nwhat I had done was enough punishment.\\n-- \\nDoug Fowler: dxf12@po.CWRU.edu  : Me, age 4 & now: \"Mommys and Daddys & other\\n    Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love\\nmissed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, \\'cause Heaven is just a great\\nhe ran to first and made it?     : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!\"\\n',\n",

From\\nanother (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of\\nthe specialty that treats it.

Very little acne as a teenager. I\\ndidn't have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily it\\nreally only gets miserable pimples when it's dry. \\n\\nFrequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp\\nthing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under\\nthe bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day\\nvitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it  \\nis used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be\\nwhere the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease \\non my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating\\nmeat).\\n\\nKeeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm\\nwater bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will\\nhelp prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it\\nsoftens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with\\noilyness. \\n\\nBecoming convinced that the best thing to do with\\na whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any\\nprying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of\\npimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't\\nbe an infection afterwards.\\n\\nTell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry\\nmakes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an\\nincredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples). \\n\\n\\n-Jackie-\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Specifically, are there an\\ninfinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that\\nhe/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?)\\nAlso, are we \"graded\" by those around us, or has there always\\nbeen some unchanging method?  Is the person\\'s childhood taken\\ninto account?\\n\\tI\\'m sure these must sound like over-simplifications to\\nmost of you, but I figure that you\\'re the experts.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t-Quinn\\n\\n[Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect\\nthat\\'s because our primary source of information is prophets and\\nvisionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However\\nboth Jesus\\' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation\\nto John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and\\neternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that\\nimply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of\\nsimilar passages where Jesus says things like \"even XXX will be better\\noff than you in the judgement.\"  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who\\ngets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these\\npassages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens,\\nso much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or\\nhell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only\\nChristian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the\\nMormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far\\nenough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their\\nideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition\\nto the Bible and \"Holy Tradition\" of a more generic Christian sort.\\n\\nNote that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of\\nassociating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free\\nus from the results of a test that we couldn\\'t possibly pass.  If you\\nlike test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale,\\nbut he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that\\nwas prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading.\\nBecause some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it\\'s easy to\\nsee why you\\'d be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are\\ndifferences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all\\nagree that in one way or another, God cheats.\\n\\nI am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly\\nhow far God\\'s cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don\\'t\\nexplicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their\\nhearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in\\nprinciple, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear\\ndescription of how to be saved, but it\\'s not clear to me that he\\nprovided an exact description of how he\\'s going to place the dividing\\nline.  Certainly he made it clear that we can\\'t expect to know whether\\nother individuals are saved or not.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

Bishop\\nGrosseteste was quite right in what he did!\\n\\nAnother example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages.\\nHe decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific\\nVision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be a\\ndefined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn\\'t quite get around to\\ndefining it.  Now there\\'s no way this is compatible with Catholic\\ndoctrine.  The Pope\\'s doctrine was criticised by many in the Church.\\nHe went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  In\\nthe end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, he\\nrecanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the\\nChurch.\\n\\nIf you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such\\nsubjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), you\\nwill find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall\\ninto heresy or schism.\\n\\nThe teaching of all such theologians is that the commands of a Pope\\nmust be resisted if they are to the detriment of the Catholic Faith.\\nA Pope\\'s authority is given for the purpose of building up the\\nCatholic Church.  Commands in conflict with this purpose have no\\nlegal *or* moral force.\\n',\n",

I have tested it using the Windows drivers for\\nHP 7570 and HP 7574 and both worked fine.  It accepts either A or B\\nsized paper. (8.5 x 11 or 11x17).\\n\\n    I figure that the plotter is worth about $300 and the pens are worth at\\nleast another $200 more..

Even if the resurrection was a big deal (which it doesn't\\nseem to have been for either Q, Thomas, or even John to a certain degree)\\nthere are a lot of other things which the Early Christians could have been\\ndoing together that would have been worth dying for.  It is my belief that\\neven the idea of a mixed race community, which brought down regional/national\\nboundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to be\\nwilling to die.  Radical communties do that (e.g. Jonestown, Waco, Warsaw, etc)\\nBut my original point was that roman persecution (which is the only persecution\\nwe have documented proof of) was not about whether a carpenter came back from\\nthe dead.  Such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman\\nor greek mind.  My point is that avoidance of military and civic duty (i.e.\\nemperor worship) would have been much more problematic -- which has nothing\\nto do with the resurrection at all.  When nero used christians as human \\ntorches to light up his dinner party it wasn't because the believe in a \\nrisen savior, it was because they were supposedly involved in incest and\\ncannablism.

Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\\n\\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\\nline/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\\n\\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\\nprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing\\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\\nwhat it all means later on). \\n\\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\\nyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)\\n\\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above \\nprocessors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.\\nBoth versions are *100% source compatibel*. \\n\\nGrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D\\ngraphics and how to use the package.\\n\\nIf demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. \\nHowever, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for\\na lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.\\n\\nGrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

Do you mean by \"omnipotent\"\\nthat God should be able to do anything/everything?  This creates\\na self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively\\nuseless.\\n\\nTo be descriptive, omnipotence must mean \"being all-powerful\" and\\nnot \"being able to do anything/everything\".\\n\\nLet me illustrate by analogy.\\nSuppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Suppose\\nfurther that the US military could not effectively be countered by any\\nnation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country\\nat any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the\\nUS see fit.  The US would be militarily \"omnipotent\".\\n\\nBut suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not\\ninterfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current\\ncivil war in the former Yugoslavian states.\\n\\nTechnically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to \\nunilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But\\neffectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy \\nof non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to\\nstrongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would\\never be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it\\ncould actually do, although it had the power to do \"whatever it wanted\".\\nThe US would simply \"never want to interfere\" for such an idea would\\nbe beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate\\nnon-interference policy.\\n\\nGod is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, but\\nHe cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what\\nHe, Himself is.\\n\\nI hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning\\nomnipotence.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nJim B.\\n',\n",

On the drawing you have a set of\\nreference points whose true x,y positions are known.  \\n\\nNow you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron\\nDanon\\'s excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which\\nconverts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click\\nthe mouse.\\n\\nUpon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come\\nout of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways\\nfrom the known true values.  This is understandable because the\\nscanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are\\nsuccessive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and\\ncontraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process,\\nscanner errors and what have you.\\n\\nThe errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so \"global\"\\nadjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or\\nrotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.\\n\\nSo the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for\\nremoving such distortion?

As you might expect, there is a range\\nof answers.  Catholics and some others will say that divorce is never\\njustified.  (By the way, in situations where someone is being abused,\\nor for other serious cause, separation is allowed by all traditions\\nthat I know.  No one should be forced to stay in a situation where\\nthey are in danger.)  Others see it as a last resort in situations\\nthat have fallen apart badly enough that the best we can hope for is\\nto choose the lesser of evils.  In some sense the difficult legal\\nquestion turns out not to be divorce, but remarriage.  That's because\\nof Jesus' statement in Mark 10:11-12 and par.  As with so many other\\nthings, this turns on your approach to the Bible.  Conservative\\nProtestants tend to see statements like this as having no exceptions.\\nMore liberal ones are willing to make allowances for situations where\\na literal interpretation would lead to painful results.  (It is noted\\nthat at the time it was possible for a man to divorce his wife almost\\non a whim.  Thus a common explanation in the more liberal approach is\\nthat Jesus was trying to protect people from this sort of thing, not\\nto establish an absolute rule to which there could never be\\nexceptions.)  Catholics, as is typical with Catholic ethics, take a\\ntheoretical hard line, but allow for exceptions in practice through\\nthe process of anullment.  In the last discussion most of our\\nnon-Catholic readers seemed to accept with some reluctance that\\nin some cases there might be no good alternative, but there was a\\nfeeling that the church should often be doing a better job of\\nhelping people prepare for marriage and deal with problems that\\ncome up during it, and that in a properly run church, divorce\\nshould not be necessary.  --clh]\\n\",\n",

       " u'From: jayne@mmalt.guild.org (Jayne Kulikauskas)\\nSubject: What\\'s in a name?: the sequel\\nOrganization: Kulikauskas home\\nLines: 57\\n\\nI\\'ve been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington, \\nI think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of \\netymology.  I\\'ve been reflecting on what certain words meant in my \\nchildhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. \\n\\nI grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very \\nangry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It \\ncarried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some \\ntime to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ\\' and \\n`Christian\\'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To \\nbecome a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would \\nconsider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared \\nto pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a \\nbetter bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable \\nriches of knowing Christ.\\n\\nAs it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that \\nthey were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time \\nthey had decided it wasn\\'t a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They \\ndidn\\'t disown me but they didn\\'t completely accept the situation either.  \\nFor example, they didn\\'t come to my wedding because it was in a church.   \\nWhen I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her \\ndeath, she said to me, \"As far as I\\'m concerned, you still are a Jew.\" \\nWhat she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a \\nJew.  I am a Christian.  (I\\'ll concede, one that likes chicken soup with \\nmatzoh balls.:-)) \\n\\nI do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My \\nsons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who \\ndo consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people \\nJews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.\\n\\nThis is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their \\nexperience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while \\nfollowing Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  \\n\\nI am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.  \\nIt was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have \\na sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small \\nsacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it \\nand do not want to ask for it back.\\n\\nAnd while I don\\'t have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.  \\nI am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the \\nChurch.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is \\nthat it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, \\nbeing rooted in the past. \\n\\nThis is probably one of the reasons why I don\\'t like it when people mess \\naround with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of \\nEaster).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.\\n\\nI suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn\\'t assume that all \\nbelievers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish \\nChristian\\' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. \\n\\nJayne Kulikauskas/jayen@mmalt.guild.org\\n',\n",
